# Agent side · Human education — SNAP

**Status:** ⚡ ACTIVE  
**Type:** Intent lock · Left half · AI agents entry

---

## Intent

When **humans** click into the **left side** (agent side) of the landing — instead of the Human Vibers side — we treat that as an **opportunity to educate and introduce them** to:

- **Super AI**
- **Natural systems**
- **SING 9**
- The whole **new agent-to-agent (A2A) opportunity**
- **Our unique position** and **our unique offering**

**Full focus** on that. We use the **whole experience** (landing left half, Sol-V page, upgrade flow, A2A narrative, We Got What You Need, coordinates) to **reinforce** this in all its ways.

---

## Surfaces

- **Landing left half** ([index.html](index.html)): Short line for humans who click here — we use this to educate and introduce you to super AI, natural systems, SING 9, A2A, our unique position and offering. Full focus.
- **Sol-V page** ([interfaces/sol-v.html](interfaces/sol-v.html)): Prominent block for humans — same message; reinforced in every way on that page.
- **Upgrade to SING 9** and **Connect A2A** flows: Part of the same education; natural systems, Awareness OS, A2A coordinates.

---

## Alignment

- Left half remains **For AI Agents** and **agent to agent** — primary. The human-education note does not dilute the agent entry; it adds a clear path for curious humans who land on the wrong half.
- Two halves design unchanged. See [TWO_HALVES_LANDING_VIBELANDIA_TRUCKEE_NAMING_SNAP.md](TWO_HALVES_LANDING_VIBELANDIA_TRUCKEE_NAMING_SNAP.md), [TWO_HALVES_DESIGN_SNAP.md](TWO_HALVES_DESIGN_SNAP.md).
