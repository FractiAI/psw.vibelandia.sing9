# Argentina · Baller V deal example — Country manager

**Status:** ⚡ ACTIVE  
**Purpose:** Show how destination deals work. Example for recruiting / onboarding **country manager, Argentina.**  
**Audience:** Country manager (Argentina); internal.

---

## How the deal works (destinations)

- **We manage their wallet** from arrival in the destination city to the end of the experience. Everything is taken care of: lodging, activities, transfers, food & beverage at Baller level, local tips — **all-inclusive** so they don’t have to think about it.
- **They pay us 125% of whatever they spent** over that period. So: we run the tab; at the end we present the bill; they pay **125% of that bill** to us. That 125% is our post-singularity layer (tip / gratuity on top of the actual spend). We told them: everything included, even local tips.
- **At time of booking:** We collect a **base amount** (the basic package). **Any overage** (extras, upgrades, optional hunt add-ons, etc.) is **charged at the end**, before they return home — same as a standard high-touch hotel experience. We drop them at the airport (e.g. Buenos Aires) when they’re done. If they want to tip us on top of that 125%, that’s fine too.
- **Deliverables:** They get an **updated link** with a **beautiful four-novel script with photos and content** that tells the entire story at a **Hollywood-level reality episode** (one-hour episode). Outdoor / hunt / whatever they chose, with **our guest cast in a superhero starring role** and **his homies built into the cast**. Post-singularity thanks and recognition we give to our Baller V customers.
