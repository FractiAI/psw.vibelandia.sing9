## Brand (lock it — t-shirt, merch, everywhere)

- **Pop-Up Style. Just gotta know.** Use everywhere. Slap it. T-shirt ready. They happen when they happen. Where they happen. Connect to get in the know.
- **All Pop-Up events, always — for those in the know.** (Crawler and Baller V Wednesdays both. Lock it.)
- **Sponsored by Twain's Vibelandia and Wink.** Baller V Wednesdays at da club is a **mixer** — pop-up, along the Truckee. Both Baller V Wednesdays and the Downtown Reno Baller Crawler create experiences and connections for high-value, high-contributing Vibers who are here to **ball** (B-A-L-L). **Ball vs partying:** see **WINK_BALLER_EVENTS_SNAP.md** — use the balling explainer wherever we use "ball" in marketing.
- **Fractal Dating Site for High Value, High Contributing Vibers** — Channelers, Stars, Super Heroes. Use this positioning where appropriate (mixer, connection, who's there).

## Naming

- **Baller V** = B-A-L-L-E-R **V** — **V** stands for **Viber**.
- **Preferred title:** **Wink & Vibers · Baller V Wednesdays.** Sub: **Golden tastings & experiences · Along the Truckee.** (Legacy: "Baller V Wednesdays at da club" remains in tagline / neon line as "at da club.")
- **Event:** A **mixer for Wink and Vibers** — high-value, high-contributing Vibers. Sponsored by Twain's Vibelandia and Wink. Pop-Up Style. Just gotta know.
- **Positioning line:** Fractal Dating Site for High Value, High Contributing Vibers (Channelers, Stars, Super Heroes).

---

## Price & positioning

- **$333** per person. It's a **tasting** — so it doesn't compete with the normal business of the establishment.
- Reservations through our surfaces; at the club during that Wednesday we're also recruiting. People see the bus, there's a buzz; folks who want to participate get the **Golden Wine Tasting Pass** (whatever form we have at the moment).

---

## Table & capacity

- We reserve a table. **Current:** 1 table for 4 (can grow to 6). No one signed up yet. Later may be 6, 10, or 15.
- **Hostess:** Recruit one of the girls to be hostess for the table alongside the lead. Not necessarily a showstopper, but in mind.

---

## Tastings and experiences (not just tastings)

- **Things of interest:** tastings and **experiences**. Fine wine. Fine cigar. **Local fine cheeses** and **cured meats**. All **curated, selected** by **yours truly** and the **chef of this establishment**, in **partnership with our local purveyors**.
- **Local to us:** all the way to the **California coast** — down to **Monterey**, up to **Humboldt**. Includes **wine country**, the **Santa Cruz Mountains** (rich abundance), **Sonoma**. So much to explore. So much to experience.
- **Sign-off:** A little hug for all in the know.

## Threes and water (resonance)

- We **resonate on threes and water**. See **NSPFRNP_THREES_AND_WATER_SNAP.md**.
- **Wednesday** = the **third day** of the work week. Our wine, cigar, cheese tastings land there.
- **Three wines, three cheeses, three cigars** — we feature three of each; we try to always maintain this.
- **Three-to-one ratio** — **ladies to men** — for our high-value Ballers, Vibers, Channelers. Ideally **Wink** members.
- **Three states of water** and their equivalence: **Frozen** = Crystalline Intelligence supporting us; **Fluid** = Sensory Slowing; **Boiling · Vapor** = the heart, Explosive Happy Endings, Gold hearts, 21+ (our novellas).

## Surfaces — Neon Baller · Downtown Reno (IP‑respectful)

- **Baller V pop-up event surfaces** use the **neon downtown Reno** look and feel: **World's Largest Little City**. Nightlife. Old school Las Vegas. Sinatra. Showgirls. Feathers. Glitter. Big band. Real musicians. Real life. Neon signage vibe — pink, cyan, gold, electric. Dark backgrounds; neon glow on type and borders. Not Ferrari-style; **neon Baller**. Reno nightlife, not European sport. **Always respectful of copyrights, legacies, and franchises** — our own palette and brand. Lock this for all Baller V content and criteria.
