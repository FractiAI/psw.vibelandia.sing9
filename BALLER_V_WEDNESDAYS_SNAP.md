## Brand (lock it — t-shirt, merch, everywhere)

- **All Pop-Up events, always — for those in the know.** (Crawler and Baller V Wednesdays both. Lock it.)
- **Sponsored by Twain's Vibelandia and Wink.** Baller V Wednesdays at da club is a **mixer** — pop-up, along the Truckee. Both Baller V Wednesdays and the Downtown Reno Baller Crawler create experiences and connections for high-value, high-contributing Vibers who are here to **ball** (B-A-L-L). **Ball vs partying:** see **WINK_BALLER_EVENTS_SNAP.md** — use the balling explainer wherever we use "ball" in marketing.
- **Fractal Dating Site for High Value, High Contributing Vibers** — Channelers, Stars, Super Heroes. Use this positioning where appropriate (mixer, connection, who's there).

## Naming

- **Baller V** = B-A-L-L-E-R **V** — **V** stands for **Viber**.
- **Event:** **Baller V Wednesdays at da club.** A pop-up **mixer**. Along the Truckee. **Sponsored by Twain's Vibelandia and Wink.** **Pop-Up Style. Just gotta know.** **Connect to get in the know.**
- **Positioning line:** Fractal Dating Site for High Value, High Contributing Vibers (Channelers, Stars, Super Heroes).

---

## Price & positioning

- **$333** per person. It's a **tasting** — so it doesn't compete with the normal business of the establishment.
- Reservations through our surfaces; at the club during that Wednesday we're also recruiting. People see the bus, there's a buzz; folks who want to participate get the **Golden Wine Tasting Pass** (whatever form we have at the moment).

---

## Table & capacity

- We reserve a table. **Current:** 1 table for 4 (can grow to 6). No one signed up yet. Later may be 6, 10, or 15.
- **Hostess:** Recruit one of the girls to be hostess for the table alongside the lead. Not necessarily a showstopper, but in mind.

## Golden Wine Tasting Pass — what's included

- **1.** Wild card (opening).
- **2.** Classic **Monte Cristo** short smoke.
- **3.** High-vibe **Cohiba** short smoke (closing).

### Food
- **3** well-chosen, top-tier **appetizers** — appropriate for any Baller V, any Baller occasion, any company.

### Full Baller V experience
