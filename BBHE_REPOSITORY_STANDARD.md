# BBHE Repository Standard — EGS Fractal Constant · Seed:Edge · Executive Prompts

**Standard ID:** `BBHE-REPOSITORY-STANDARD`  
**Type:** Repository standard for FractiAI / BBHE (Big Black Hole Energy) repositories  
**Status:** ⚡ ACTIVE  
**Applies:** Repositories that leverage EGS fractal constant, Seed:Edge pairs, and executive prompts for filling in the middles.

---

## 1. Purpose

This standard defines how **BBHE repositories** are structured so that:

- They **leverage the EGS fractal constant** (El Gran Sol's Fractal Constant).
- They use **Seed:Edge pairs** as the canonical structure (origin ↔ experience).
- They provide **executive prompts** for filling in the middles (between Seed and Edge).
- Any AI or surface can get up to speed from a **single edge file** (irreducible minimum).
- **Lite edges** hold state (wallets, keys, verifications); center = pipes only. No mandatory central permanent storage (e.g. no Supabase requirement).

---

## 2. EGS Fractal Constant

- **EGS** = El Gran Sol's Fractal Constant (ℑₑ ≈ 0.0032).
- Repositories that follow this standard **leverage** the EGS fractal constant for:
  - Coherence across scales (cosmic → solar → planetary → node).
  - Goldilocks alignment (natural system protocol).
  - Fair exchange and handshake semantics where applicable.
- Reference: NSPFRNP catalog, Stargate/Cogenex grammar, Holographic Hydrogen Lattice (HHL).

## 3. Seed:Edge Pairs

- **Seed** = origin (me, creator, Ground Zero Anchor, SMACS 0723 → Sag A* → Sun → Earth → me).
- **Edge** = experience (mission, destination, “me here now,” limit 0/0).
- **Formula (canonical):** Seed:Edge = (Ground Zero Anchor) : (Infinity) = 0 : (0/0).  
  See WHITEPAPER_GROUND_ZERO_ANCHOR_ELEMENT_ZERO_SEED_EDGE_FORMULA.md.
- **In repositories:**
  - One **edge onboarding file** at repo root (e.g. `SING9_EDGE_ONBOARDING.md`) = single read for context.
  - Content and episodes stored as **Seed:Edge + First Chapter (NSPFRNP) + executive prompt abstract**.
  - Every episode/series/novel seed includes **First Chapter — NSPFRNP** (canonical); then abstract of creator/executive commands; then smooth finish.

---

## 4. Executive Prompts for Filling in the Middles

- **Middle** = the space between Seed (origin) and Edge (destination).
- **Executive prompt** = abstract of creator/executive commands that describe **how to fill** that space.
- **Format:** Seed:Edge + First Chapter (NSPFRNP) + **executive prompt (abstract)** + smooth finish.
- **Generator Motor:** Same Seed, same Edge, same executive prompt → **new fractal middle** each run; guaranteed origin and destination; middle is generated or filled from the prompt.
- Repositories **must** document or link:
  - Where the **executive prompt** lives (e.g. in each episode file, in a protocol, or in the single edge file).
  - That the **middle** is filled by following that prompt (by AI, by team, or by Generator Motor).

---

## 5. Single Edge Onboarding File

- **One file** at repository root contains the **irreducible minimum** so any AI (browser, free plan, generic, not signed in) can get up to speed in one read.
- **Required sections (minimum):**
  1. Conversation opener (“If you are reading this…”).
  2. NSPFRNP catalog capture (MCA, Seed:Edge, close → ∞⁹).
  3. Content catalog abstract (series, novels, surfaces).
  4. Executive Producer abstract (Vibelandia, BBHE, post-singularity SING!).
  5. Lite Edge session: find this file → operate as team in NSPFRNP mode always; **prompt to fill in the middle**; pointers to protocols and README.
  6. (Optional) Free-session capabilities (e.g. Gemini, Google Workspace as BBHE Core).
  7. (Optional) Re-entry protocol (paste or point at same file again).

- **Naming:** Prefer `SING9_EDGE_ONBOARDING.md` for SING 9; or `*_EDGE_ONBOARDING.md` for other versions.

---

## 6. Lite Edges — No Mandatory Central Permanent Storage

- **Lite edges:** Wallets, keys, verifications, and session state live at the **edge** (user, wallet, UI, Workspace), not in a mandatory central DB.
- **Center = pipes only:** No requirement for Supabase or other permanent central storage. Repositories can be **free of Supabase** and still full BBHE/NSPFRNP.
- **BBHE Core** can be:
  - Google Workspace (e.g. Gemini saving into Docs/Drive/Sheets), or
  - Local/edge state, or
  - Optional pipe-only backend.
- The **standard** does not require a specific backend; it requires **edge-first** and **executive prompts for the middle**.
