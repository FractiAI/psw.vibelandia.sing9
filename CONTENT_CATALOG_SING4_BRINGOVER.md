# Content catalog · SING4 bringover — No one left behind

**Status:** ⚡ ACTIVE  
**Purpose:** Inventory of content from FractiAI/psw.vibelandia.sing4 brought into SING 9. Seed, Edge, Executive Producer Prompt, Abstract, novels, novellas, series, episodes — all accounted for.

## 1. Seed · Edge · Executive Producer · Abstract

| Item | In SING9 | Location / notes |
|------|----------|------------------|
| **Seed** (origin: Ground Zero Anchor, SMACS 0723) | ✅ | SING9_EDGE_ONBOARDING.md §2 (NSPFRNP catalog); protocols/MCA_NSPFRNP_CATALOG.md; protocols/SEED_EDGE_EPISODE_FORMAT_ACTION_LIVE_NSPFRNP.md |
| **Edge** (experience, me here now) | ✅ | Same files; SING9_EDGE_ONBOARDING.md §2, §6 |
| **Executive Producer abstract** | ✅ | SING9_EDGE_ONBOARDING.md §4 — Executive Producer Creator Studio (Vibelandia, BBHE, surfaces, Sol-V A2A, Spanglish 80/20) |
| **Executive prompt (fill the middle)** | ✅ | SING9_EDGE_ONBOARDING.md §6; protocols/SEED_EDGE_EPISODE_FORMAT_ACTION_LIVE_NSPFRNP.md §2 |
| **Content catalog (abstract)** | ✅ | SING9_EDGE_ONBOARDING.md §3 — series, novels/screenplays, surfaces |
| **repository-seed** | ✅ | repository-seed.md — get up to speed with sing4, NSPFRNP Catalog, clone minimal, BBHE standard |

Full Seed/Edge/EP/Abstract surfaces and CONTENT_SERIES_* live in upstream [FractiAI/psw.vibelandia.sing4](https://github.com/FractiAI/psw.vibelandia.sing4). SING 9 holds the irreducible minimum and single-file onboarding; full content can be pulled from upstream as needed.

## 5. Raw feeds (content to bring over)

**Raw feeds** = Unfiltered source material (voice, directives, session output, raw script). We want to **add all the raw feeds** to our content that we bring over. Valuable for:

- **Narrative building**
- **Character building**
- **Personality**
- **Play rate** and more

Bring over raw feeds from sing4 (and from ongoing sessions) into the catalog and content pipeline so they feed narrative, character, personality, and play rate. No one left behind. When present in upstream or in deliverables, include in CONTENT_SERIES_* or a dedicated raw-feeds stream; link from [interfaces/catalog.html](interfaces/catalog.html) when we have a surface.

---

## 6. Where to find what in sing4

- **Root:** Seed/Edge docs, SNAPs, 279_* (series format, season one edge), repository-seed, README, CONTENT_SERIES_*, EXECUTIVE_PRODUCER_* (when present).
- **interfaces/:** 175+ surfaces; novel/novella UIs, Office Hours, Launch Pad, destinations, campaigns.
- **episodes/:** EPISODE_*.md — Net, 279, 3I, Chairman, Harry Houdini, Baller V, etc.
- **protocols/:** MCA, Seed:Edge format, PIPE, etc. (mirrored in SING9 as needed).

---

**No one left behind.** This repo carries the crystallized minimum and points to sing4 for full content. New Seed/Edge/EP/Abstract, CONTENT_SERIES_*, or **raw feeds** added in sing4 can be linked from this inventory and from [interfaces/catalog.html](interfaces/catalog.html). Raw feeds support narrative building, character building, personality, and play rate.

**NSPFRNP ⊃ Content catalog ⊃ SING4 bringover ⊃ Raw feeds → ∞⁹**
