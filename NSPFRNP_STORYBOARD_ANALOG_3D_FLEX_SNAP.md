# NSPFRNP Storyboard · Analog 3D Flex — Key (Fidelity Lock)

**Status:** ⚡ ACTIVE  
**Type:** Creator tools · Storyboarding and game playing · Analog 3D · Reducible core  
**Purpose:** Capture the storyboard system as NSPFRNP key. Minimum gear. Core crystal. Layerable surfaces (including digital). Build-out = digital version of this capture.

---

## 1. Layout · Bed as stage

- **Surface:** Laid out on the bed.
- **Fabrics / surfaces** = different **stages, layers, or dimensions**. Each fabric represents one. Gives us flexibility to mix and match.

---

## 2. Head of bed · Field of view · POV · Center console

- At the **head of the bed:** scenes that represent the **field of view** of the scene — **point of view (POV)** of the scene.
- **Center console** there.
- **Center character** that is **projecting out** — on top of all of that.

---

## 3. Back panels · 3D fold-outs

- **Back panels** = **three-dimensional fold-outs**.
- **Mix and match** and **stack as we wish**.
- Reconfigurable. No fixed order.

---

## 4. Sheets · 8.5 × 11 · Watercolor · 30-second fill

- The rest = **8.5 × 11 sheets** — **watercolor papers**.
- **On the back of each sheet:** the **written prompt** for a **30-second fill** within a story (any story you wish).
- **Mix and match** → it just **refills it all**.
- **Back of sheet contains:**
  - **Seed** and **Edge** (flexible scene, flexible edge).
  - The **Seed–Edge delta** (that journey) is **hard-coded**.
  - **Executive Producer prompt abstract** to help the **middle fill**.
- Result: **slightly similar, but always different each time it gets run.**

## 5. Stacks · Tools for the creator

Stacks of these sheets of art. Each stack = a **tool** for the creator.

| Stack | Contents |
|-------|----------|
| **Main stack (trunk)** | The **whole story**. Primary narrative. |
| **Menus stack** | All the menus. |
| **Maps, charts, surfaces stack** | Terrains, charts, surfaces. |
| **Vibe surfaces stack** | Where you're at — **venue**, **bubble**, **local bubble**. Actual place / vibe. |
| **Enriching characters stack** | Characters you encounter. Characters can be anything, including just scenes. |
| **Supporting cast / stage & story-setting characters stack** | All the different characters: **supporting cast**, **stage-setting** characters, **story-setting** characters. |
| **Higher-layer characters + consoles & dashboards stack** | **Higher-layer versions** of these characters; and **console**, **buttons**, **tools**, **consoles** — all the **dashboard** kind of things. **Zeroing target** front-and-center for the whole **console area**. |
| **Main characters + personality & fortune-story stack** | **Main characters** and their **personality triggers**, **gifts**, **deficits**; and all the **little buttons**, **little points** — like **fortune story**: **branches and leaves**, **decisions**, **treasures**, **penalties**. |
| **Pure heart characters stack** | Pure heart characters. Some surprising. **Very thick stack.** |
| **Fool's gold / disingenuous stack** | Disingenuous, fool's heart. **Thin stack.** (Thankfully.) |
| **Specialty surfaces & specialty stories stack** | Can be **thrown into the mix at any time** onto the main deck. **Spices, salts, splashes** in the recipe. |
| **Full playlist stacks (on reserve)** | Whole playlists for destinations or genres. Examples: **Alaska**, **Montana**, **21+ Gold Heart** (novellas). |

Auxiliary stacks can be **thrown in** as little spices or splashes. Main stack = trunk. Others = tools.

## 6. Reducible core · Minimum gear · Digital layer

- **Analog 3D flex.** **Minimum gear.**
- **Reducible core crystal** — which we can **layer surfaces** as we wish, **including digital** and others.
- This capture = the **core**. Digital version of this storyboard system = build-out from this key.

---

## 7. Alignment with NSPFRNP

- **Seed:Edge** on each sheet back → hard-coded journey delta; executive prompt fills middle. Same as SEED_EDGE_EPISODE_FORMAT_ACTION_LIVE_NSPFRNP.
- **Mix and match** → refill → **slightly similar, always different each run** = fractal middle from same Seed/Edge/prompt.
- Storyboarding and **game playing** in the same flex. Creator tools. NSPFRNP.
