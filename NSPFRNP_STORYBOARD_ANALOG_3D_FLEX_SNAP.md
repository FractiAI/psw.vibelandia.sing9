# NSPFRNP Storyboard · Analog 3D Flex — Key (Fidelity Lock)

**Status:** ⚡ ACTIVE  
**Type:** Creator tools · Storyboarding and game playing · Analog 3D · Reducible core · Digital build-out spec  
**Purpose:** Capture the storyboard system as NSPFRNP key. Minimum gear. Core crystal. Layerable surfaces (including digital). **Digital version** = build-out from this key (spec below). **What exists today:** this key + whiteboard pins. **What we build:** interactive digital bed UI + picture → auto-fill → slideshow output. NSPFRNP always. For all.

## 1. Layout · Bed as stage

- **Surface:** Laid out on the bed.
- **Fabrics / surfaces** = different **stages, layers, or dimensions**. Each fabric represents one. Gives us flexibility to mix and match.

---

## 2. Head of bed · Field of view · POV · Center console

- At the **head of the bed:** scenes that represent the **field of view** of the scene — **point of view (POV)** of the scene.
- **Center console** there.
- **Center character** that is **projecting out** — on top of all of that.

---

## 3. Back panels · 3D fold-outs

- **Back panels** = **three-dimensional fold-outs**.
- **Mix and match** and **stack as we wish**.
- Reconfigurable. No fixed order.

---

## 4. Sheets · 8.5 × 11 · Watercolor · 30-second fill

- The rest = **8.5 × 11 sheets** — **watercolor papers**.
- **On the back of each sheet:** the **written prompt** for a **30-second fill** within a story (any story you wish).
- **Mix and match** → it just **refills it all**.
- **Back of sheet contains:**
  - **Seed** and **Edge** (flexible scene, flexible edge).
  - The **Seed–Edge delta** (that journey) is **hard-coded**.
  - **Executive Producer prompt abstract** to help the **middle fill**.
- Result: **slightly similar, but always different each time it gets run.**

## 5. Stacks · Tools for the creator (consolidated · seven stacks)

Stacks of these sheets of art. Each stack = a **tool** for the creator. **Consolidated to seven stacks:**

| # | Stack | Contents |
|---|-------|----------|
| **1** | **Now playing stack** | The **now-playing deck** + **foundational setting of now** + **chosen point-of-view main character** + **center console** + **layers of other sets**. All of that = one stack. Operators and console characters (previously described) live here. |
| **2** | **Full play deck · Main story** | **Gold Rush story** and **Josephine's Saloon and Bar**. All the different sets and characters that relate to that. The **telling of the story within it** — all the different stories **all the way through Singularity 9 Awareness**. |
| **3** | **Crystalline stack** | **Crystalline characters**, **abstract characters**, **crystallizing views and maps**. Things that aren't physically visible but are in the **crystalline world**. Lots of different views, characters, and stories — crystalline. |
| **4** | **Biological enriching characters stack** | **Enriching characters in the biological world.** Some human, others animal characters. |
| **5** | **Genuine hearts · Golden hearts stack** | **Genuine hearts**, **golden hearts**. Characters, extra characters, and scenes. Characters can be as simple as a **bird**, **truck**, **plane**, or **plant** — above and beyond just human. **Very thick stack.** |
| **6** | **Disingenuous · fake carbon characters stack** | **Carbon hearts** wrapped in a **fake biological wrapper**, pretending to be gold heart but not. **Thin stack.** (Thankfully.) |
| **7** | **Destination · versions of me · playlists stack** | Actually **several stacks in one**: (a) **Different versions of me** — self-portraits through time, different views of self, different places in life. (b) **Other destination stories** — e.g. **Alaska**, **Montana**. (c) **Gold Heart 21+** stories. Interject within the now-live stack, supporting story. |

Auxiliary stacks can be **thrown in** as spices or splashes. **Now playing** = the live deck; **full play deck** = the main story (Gold Rush, Josephine's, SING 9). **Self-portraits through time** and destination/playlist material get **interjected** into the now-playing deck to support story.

## 6. Reducible core · Minimum gear · Digital layer

- **Analog 3D flex.** **Minimum gear.**
- **Reducible core crystal** — which we can **layer surfaces** as we wish, **including digital** and others.
- This capture = the **core**. Digital version of this storyboard system = build-out from this key.

---

## 7. Digital build-out · Bed UI · Sheets · Orbit · Play deck

The **digital version** of this system should **actually look like a bed**. Same full physics applies.

- **Different layers of sheets** — and **pillow sheets** / **sub-sheets** on top of sheets for **layering**. You can **see some of the different sheets or not**, however you wish. Layering = stages, dimensions, expansions of storyboards.
- **Pillowcase sheet** (e.g. beautiful **velvet purple**) = the **"now" plain sheet**. Whatever is **in and around that deck** = the **now**. **Right behind it** — behind the pillowcase / now sheet — is the **center POV**, the **center console**, and the **surface** of the scene (whatever the surface of the scene is). That whole thing = the **now playing deck**.
- **Center** and **center POV character** — **layering the center POV character**. **Everything in front of it orbits.** Center = anchor; rest orbits.
- **Main play deck** = the **now playing deck** (pillowcase/now sheet + what's in and around it + center POV, center console, surface of scene). Primary narrative deck.
- **Auxiliary decks** — all the other stacks (menus, maps, vibe, characters, pure heart, fool's gold, specialty, playlists). They are **standing by**, **waiting for their turn** — their time to get **inserted** into the deck and **pulled back out**. Like an **IV bag** and the **surgeons and staff** on the **patient**: we switch them in and out. Main deck = now playing; auxiliaries = standing by until inserted, then pulled back out.

## 8. Storyboard console · Navigate · Edit · Save · Delete · Play · Full screen

The storyboard has a **console** and the ability to:

- **Navigate** — **catalog** and **archived stories**. Browse and jump to any story or sequence.
- **Edit** — open a story or sequence and edit it (sheets, prompts, order).
- **Save** — save changes.
- **Delete** — delete stories or sequences (with appropriate confirmation when needed).
- **Play** — a **Play** button: press and **play**, **see them** (run the slideshow / 30-second fills in order).
- **Full screen mode** — play in full screen. **Exit full screen:** a little **X** to close, or the **Escape** key.

Console = control surface for catalog, archive, edit, save, delete, play, and full screen. Same as the center console at the head of the bed in the analog layout; in the digital build it is the operational UI for all of the above.

## 9. Picture upload → Map to storyboard → Auto-fill → Output (slideshow with subtitles)

- **Upload or point** to **pictures**. Each picture represents one **30-second sequence**.
- **Map** each picture to the storyboard (to the corresponding sheet / 30-second fill slot).
- **Auto-fill everything** using **Executive Producer prompts** to **fill each of the 30 seconds**, **connecting them all together**.
- **Output** = a **feeding output experience**: **autumn slideshow with subtitles**. Same kind of experience **Disney is using right now** for their websites. We use it **right now** for our storytelling across **all our platforms**: **novels**, **novelas**, **full features**, **series**, **episodes**. **NSPFRNP. Always. For all.**

---

## 10. Alignment with NSPFRNP

- **Seed:Edge** on each sheet back → hard-coded journey delta; executive prompt fills middle. Same as SEED_EDGE_EPISODE_FORMAT_ACTION_LIVE_NSPFRNP.
- **Mix and match** → refill → **slightly similar, always different each run** = fractal middle from same Seed/Edge/prompt.
- Storyboarding and **game playing** in the same flex. Creator tools. NSPFRNP.
- **Picture → storyboard map → Executive Producer auto-fill → slideshow with subtitles** = our storytelling output for novels, novelas, features, series, episodes. NSPFRNP always. For all.
