# Pru's Valet Service — SNAP (internal)

**Status:** ⚡ ACTIVE  
**Type:** Brand · Pop-up umbrella · Human Vibers · Raw script + positioning  
**Spell:** P-R-U apostrophe S. **Pru's Valet Service.**

---

## Brand lock

- **Pru's Valet Service** is the organizing umbrella for **all pop-up events** (Downtown Truckee River Baller V Crawler, Baller V Wednesdays, destinations, future rollouts).
- **Do not bind the brand to a city.** Keep "Downtown Reno" out of the Pru's Valet Service brand name so the brand travels: Buenos Aires, Punta Cana, anywhere we roll out. Use "Downtown Reno" only as location context (e.g. "Currently in Downtown Reno," or in menu item descriptions), not in the service name.
- When Human Vibers click through from the landing, **everything is framed within Pru's Valet Service** — then the pop-ups as the menu.

---

## What pop-up means

- We are **not competing with our vendors.** We're adding a **new layer.** We're not forcing that layer on anyone; we're **giving them the option.**
- **We have no formal relationship with our vendors** — they are **our picks** for who we work with to deliver our **post-singularity Baller V services to our members.**
- Our high-value, high-contributing Vibers are a **different breed.** When they want to ball, they ball because they know they deserve it. **Price is not an object.** These are our customers. Our guests. Who we represent. The world is not a kind place; the world preys on these folks; they're not getting a fair shake. **Pru's Valet Service handles this for them.**

---

## Servant · Valet · Host

- As I have done all my life. I trust it. **Servant. Valet. Host. Cultured.** Consider me like a **butler.** I got you.
- No different than having a **designated driver** when you know you're going to go out drinking. It's dangerous to drink and drive; it's illegal. It's **even more dangerous to drink and ball** with a limitless credit card and nobody there sober to trust, to help carry the night, guarantee the night.
- On top of that: **choreographed and scripted** like a fine Hollywood reality show — with **you as the Superstar.** Cast. Crew. Franchises. Legacies. Maybe a few lucky fans. **All turnkey. All fair trade, fair shake. Always.**
- No more being preyed on because of your **Viber nature** by the computational-minded reality we currently exist in — and that is currently in transition into awareness of us, and our gifts, and our special needs.

## Raw script — keep for tone and excitement (we say these words)

*Yes, special needs. Yes, genius we are. Yes, gifted we are. And yes, labeled and treated by the current world as freaks. Cash cows. Asperger's. Cases. Nuts. Eccentrics. Creatives. Polymaths. We are all these things. And we are the gifts from the other side. And without us, there is nothing. We are the branches, we are the trunks, we are the roots that support the leaves. Not the other way around. With the sun as our witness and servant. We say these words. For all.*

---

## Two modes (when we show everything — right side)

- **Pre-singularity mode:** Normal. Give them the **links** (to partners, written content, destinations). They **do it themselves.** No invocation.
- **Post-singularity · Baller B mode:** **Invoke with us.** We handle it with them. Full service, Pru's Valet, turnkey.
- Present both simply on the Vibers side (e.g. Pru's Valet menu): choose your mode. Nice and simple. Same two halves idea — normal vs Baller B.

---

## Bookings (all offline — old school)

- **All bookings handled offline.** When they press **Book:** send an **email to owner** (e.g. info@fractiai.com). Old school.
- **After they pay** — PayPal. We confirm. No in-app payment flow; we send link or instructions, they pay, we confirm.
- **Or:** a button to **Contact me** if they need to **talk about it first.** Then Book after.
- Surfaces: **Book** (mailto with subject line for the offering) and **Contact me to talk first** (mailto). Simple.
- Lock: Bookings = email to owner on Book; payment via PayPal after; Contact me option always available.

## Menu surface (Human Vibers entry)

- **Experience, not transaction.** Story and safari/explorer skin. Take us through it. Chart, expedition feel. Same water background as landing (Human Vibers side).
- **Letterhead:** Mark Twain's Post-Singularity Vibelandia (main) → Pru's Valet Service → For Human Vibers and Channelers.
- **Menu (five ways in):** (1) Downtown Truckee River Baller V Crawler, (2) Baller V Wednesdays, (3) Destinations · Magazine Catalog, (4) Our content catalog (novels, novellas, series, episodes), (5) **Baller V & Destinations Operators** — local and destination operators, experienced, interested in being included. Click Vendors → pre-fill email to us; we'll get back to you; handled offline, old school.
- **Include the prices. Right up front.**

## Real-world surfacing · Arrival & at-the-club

- **Surface "buttons"** in the real world at **points of planning** (anyone planning a trip to Reno) and **arrival points** — we focus on **downtown casino hotel lobbies** (not airport). Target: **downtown dwellers**, **baller vibes only.** Get the word out on arrival in a **natural flow.** Recruit **cast** (dance/performer) to hand out **one invitation card** (Wednesday + Third Saturday together); **only where there's a connection**, subtle, respectful of businesses. **At the club:** pop-up when busy; spontaneous join; man can invite lady friends at table; **$100 (hundy)** each when they make it happen (down-low). Full spec: [REAL_WORLD_SURFACING_ARRIVAL_RECRUITMENT_SNAP.md](REAL_WORLD_SURFACING_ARRIVAL_RECRUITMENT_SNAP.md).

## Content notes

- **Photos and catalogs:** Need correction. To be updated separately with the team. Noted here so we don't lose track.
