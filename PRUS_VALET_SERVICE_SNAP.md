# Pru's Valet Service — SNAP (internal)

**Status:** ⚡ ACTIVE  
**Type:** Brand · Pop-up umbrella · Human Vibers · Raw script + positioning  
**Spell:** P-R-U apostrophe S. **Pru's Valet Service.**

---

## Brand lock

- **Pru's Valet Service** is the organizing umbrella for **all pop-up events** (Baller Crawler, Baller V Wednesdays, destinations, future rollouts).
- **Do not bind the brand to a city.** Keep "Downtown Reno" out of the Pru's Valet Service brand name so the brand travels: Buenos Aires, Punta Cana, anywhere we roll out. Use "Downtown Reno" only as location context (e.g. "Currently in Downtown Reno," or in menu item descriptions), not in the service name.
- When Human Vibers click through from the landing, **everything is framed within Pru's Valet Service** — then the pop-ups as the menu.

---

## What pop-up means

- We are **not competing with our vendors.** We're adding a **new layer.** We're not forcing that layer on anyone; we're **giving them the option.**
- Our high-value, high-contributing Vibers are a **different breed.** When they want to ball, they ball because they know they deserve it. **Price is not an object.** These are our customers. Our guests. Who we represent. The world is not a kind place; the world preys on these folks; they're not getting a fair shake. **Pru's Valet Service handles this for them.**

## Servant · Valet · Host

- As I have done all my life. I trust it. **Servant. Valet. Host. Cultured.** Consider me like a **butler.** I got you.
- No different than having a **designated driver** when you know you're going to go out drinking. It's dangerous to drink and drive; it's illegal. It's **even more dangerous to drink and ball** with a limitless credit card and nobody there sober to trust, to help carry the night, guarantee the night.
- On top of that: **choreographed and scripted** like a fine Hollywood reality show — with **you as the Superstar.** Cast. Crew. Franchises. Legacies. Maybe a few lucky fans. **All turnkey. All fair trade, fair shake. Always.**
- No more being preyed on because of your **Viber nature** by the computational-minded reality we currently exist in — and that is currently in transition into awareness of us, and our gifts, and our special needs.

## Raw script — keep for tone and excitement (we say these words)

*Yes, special needs. Yes, genius we are. Yes, gifted we are. And yes, labeled and treated by the current world as freaks. Cash cows. Asperger's. Cases. Nuts. Eccentrics. Creatives. Polymaths. We are all these things. And we are the gifts from the other side. And without us, there is nothing. We are the branches, we are the trunks, we are the roots that support the leaves. Not the other way around. With the sun as our witness and servant. We say these words. For all.*

## Menu surface (Human Vibers entry)

- **Crisp executive menu.** Like something you'd see in an old steakhouse. Fine establishment. The kind Chairman Sinatra himself would be dining at. **Very old school. Golden Age.** One page.
- **Include the prices. Right up front.** Prices **include 25% tip** (add 25% to base price; show the all-in number so it's clear and fair).
