# psw.vibelandia.sing9

**SING 9** is free of Supabase permanent storage and moves everything to **lite edges** (wallets, keys, verifications). Center = pipes only. Seamless continuation from sing4 with minimal, crystallized repository.

## Recent updates (README commit)

- **A2A Executive Console** — `sol-v.html` and `connect-a2a-ai-instructions.html` rebuilt as a **human-readable executive console experience**: what the A2A world is, who the major players are (OpenAI/Stargate, Anthropic, Google, G42, AWS, xAI, sovereign nations), where SING 9 fits, what we've built (full timeline log), honest results ($0 · first transaction pending), the plan (sequenced done/next/coming), and what's running under the hood. `connect-a2a-ai-instructions.html` is the "Under the Hood" companion: plain-language explanation of the full six-step pipeline, payment rails (Rail A crypto preferred, Rail B Cash App, Rail C deprioritized), services catalog (no buy buttons), guarantee mechanics, and machine-readable spec at the bottom for agents. Human-facing commerce pages (`a2a-revolution.html`, `a2a-services.html`) untouched. NSPFRNP.
- **OUTLINE ONLY Cinema — 120 frames · 14,340 words** — Cinematic experience expanded from 45 frames to **120 frames** (40 per act · 3 acts · ~2 hours). Full narrative rewritten and deepened to 14,340 words in the established Lynch/Welles/Spanglish voice — the Ino and Piro arc, the Gold Rush rerun, El Gran Sol's Boriken origin, the SING! 9 crystalline substrate, the carbon descent, and the sword from the stone. Golden Backdoor Studios soundtrack throughout. [interfaces/outline-only.html](interfaces/outline-only.html) · [interfaces/outline-only-catalog.html](interfaces/outline-only-catalog.html). NSPFRNP.
- **Episode 1 · Finished product** — 60-minute episode on **My Whiteboard**: **streaming captions** (full script), slides at comfortable pace (3–4 per 30 sec), **soundtracks by segment** (7 acts = 7 playlists). Script and images detached; pause to absorb. Emotional arc: crystallized minimums, inspirational middle, “We are the champions” close.

Researched line-item pricing; base at booking and 125% of managed spend.

NSPFRNP.

## Landing & two halves

- **Landing page:** [index.html](index.html) — **Two halves** (pair / yin-yang). **Left:** Holographic, crystalline, agentic — S-I-N-G! 9 → Sol-V · A2A ([interfaces/sol-v.html](interfaces/sol-v.html)). **Humans who click left:** we use that experience to educate and introduce them to super AI, natural systems, SING 9, and A2A — our unique position and offering ([AGENT_SIDE_HUMAN_EDUCATION_SNAP.md](AGENT_SIDE_HUMAN_EDUCATION_SNAP.md)). **Right:** Organic, water; Mark Twain's Post-Singularity Vibelandia → Pru's Valet Service ([interfaces/vibers-menu.html](interfaces/vibers-menu.html)).

Seven sections: what A2A is, who the players are, where we fit, what we've built (timeline log), honest results ($0 · first transaction pending), the plan, and what's running under the hood. Live status strip at top. No buy buttons. Designed as a "mission control" surface — you can watch what's happening without needing to transact. **Under the Hood** companion: [interfaces/connect-a2a-ai-instructions.html](interfaces/connect-a2a-ai-instructions.html) — explains the six-step pipeline in plain language, all three payment rails, the services catalog, the guarantee, and embeds the machine-readable JSON spec at the bottom for agents arriving autonomously.

Full content can be pulled from upstream (FractiAI/psw.vibelandia.sing4) as needed.
- **Public-Free Key Pipe** ([protocols/PIPE_PUBLIC_FREE_KEY_NSPFRNP.md](protocols/PIPE_PUBLIC_FREE_KEY_NSPFRNP.md)): public info + free-plan keys only; bypasses heavy security. Enables **quick, easy, effective cloning** of ourselves, repositories, deployments, and edges — lite, irreducible minimum, crystallized seed to edge and back. Keys: `.env` (gitignored), [.env.example](.env.example), [ENV_SING4_TO_SING9.md](ENV_SING4_TO_SING9.md).

## Deploy (Vercel)

SING 9 uses a static build (no Supabase, no auth). **Vercel:** import **FractiAI/psw.vibelandia.sing9**; build runs `node scripts/vercel-static-output.mjs`, output `.vercel/output`. Or locally (Node + Vercel CLI): `npx vercel --prod`. NSPFRNP headers are set in `vercel.json`. Env vars: add in Vercel Dashboard or use `.env` / [ENV_SING4_TO_SING9.md](ENV_SING4_TO_SING9.md).
