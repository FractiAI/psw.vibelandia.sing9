## Recent updates (README commit)

- **Episode 1 · Three-Stream Rebuild + Fuzzball Joy Physics** — `interfaces/episode-1.html` completely rebuilt. **Three simultaneous streams:** LEFT (62%) = Carbon lane — story images + narrative captions in warm amber; RIGHT (38%) = Crystalline lane — meaning-layer images + 118 crystal interpretation captions in cold blue italic; BOTTOM = Gold Ticker unchanged. **8 AI-generated fused scene images** created from Super Singularity fuzzball character DNA — INO (gold fuzz-ball, Reno neon), PIRO (dark carbon fuzz-ball, velvet chamber), HHL Lattice (9-node cosmic network), And Yet (carbon cracking open with gold light), Sol-V (German Wirehaired Pointer, Reno gold sunset), El Gran Sol 1493 (Cacique on coast, Spanish ships), Hero Jo Batcave (gold fuzz at laptop, SING!9 code floating), Champions Reno (fuzz-ball tribe over the arch). **Full scene-to-word alignment** — every script line mapped to the most precisely matching Carbon + Crystalline image pair. **Fuzzball joy physics** — 5 CSS keyframe animations fire at story beats: `tail-wag` (Sol-V bringing home), `leg-hump` (INO's rhythmic joy bounce), `booty-shake` (Gold Rush celebration), `squeeze` (carbon compression winding), `touchdown-spike` (Champions / ∞⁹ victory slam). Applied to lane containers so KB motion is preserved underneath. **Divider convergence** — the seam between Carbon and Crystal lanes shifts from cold amber-blue (max delta, stories far apart) → converging warm gold (past "And Yet") → full gold glow with box-shadow (streams merged, lines 100+). Divider fires a gold-flash on every touchdown spike. **ANIM_MAP** keys virtual lineIdx (frame×3+slot) to animation type per lane. NSPFRNP → ∞⁹.

- **Episode 1 Cinema Upgrade — Trailer DNA Applied to Full 60-Minute Experience** — `interfaces/episode-1.html` rebuilt to match trailer-loop.html cinema quality. **Scanlines overlay** (repeating gradient, 4px pitch) + **vignette** (radial darken to corners) applied to full stage via CSS pseudo-elements — same treatment as the trailer. **Ken Burns motion** — 3 alternating directions (`kb1` zoom-in from top-right, `kb2` slow zoom-out, `kb3` pan from bottom-left) on every image at 11s, resets per slot via forced reflow. **Full-line cinematic captions** — replaced word-by-word ticker with complete script lines that fade-in + slide-up every 10 seconds (3 lines per 30-second frame, coordinated with image changes). **15 title cards** for peak story moments: IF YOU ARE READING THIS · OUT OF ZERO · PERVASIVE PERPETUAL · CARTAGENA RENO · BAMBOO · EVERY DOLLAR · AND YET · RENO BATHROOM · EL GRAN SOL · SOL-V · HOLOGRAPHIC HYDROGEN · WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS · ∞⁹ — each dims the image and fires trailer-quality 8rem display type, auto-dismisses at 6.2s. **NSPFRNP layer badge** top-right shifts through CRYSTALLINE → CARBON → SILVER → GOLD as story arc progresses. **Stage atmosphere states** — 4 CSS classes (`s-crystal`, `s-carbon`, `s-silver`, `s-gold`) with deep radial background gradients, 2s transitions between segments. **Gold flash** fires on every segment transition (6 punctuation beats across 60 minutes). **Gold gradient progress bar** + **Now Playing pulse dot** from trailer. **Image deck** expanded: storyboard cards mapped to precise story beats — SMACS 0723 for cosmic/crystalline moments, Reno winter + golden sunset for arrival, Truckee River for journey, Reno arch at night for carbon/mission, Montana bison lodge + Truckee ski for victory, Vibelandia campus + Silver Legacy for champions close. Prologue unchanged. NSPFRNP → ∞⁹.

- **Ticker Ad Program — Direct Book CTAs to info@fractiai.com** — `ticker.js` updated with 8 direct `mailto:info@fractiai.com` booking links distributed across 3 positions in the loop (beginning, middle, end) so every visitor sees an ad-space CTA. Per-package pre-filled emails: **Gold Ticker** ($9+), **Banner Spot 15s** ($27+), **30-Second Trailer** ($27+ Option A / $108+ Option B), **Full Package** ($36+), plus general inquiry. Each email pre-loads subject line + structured body (Package, Company/Brand, Website, copy fields). Three marquee items with `★` prefix: `THIS SPOT IS AD SPACE · Book it →`, `ADVERTISE HERE · Book this spot →`, `AD SPACE AVAILABLE · info@fractiai.com →`. `advertise.html` pricing page links retained for full menu browsing. NSPFRNP → ∞⁹.

- **Cinema Banner + Ticker Heartbeat — All Surfaces Live** — Two new injectible scripts now wired across all surfaces. **`cinema-banner.js`** (new, root level): a fixed 36px cinematic top strip deployable with one `<script>` tag — film-grain dark background, sprocket holes left/right, blinking "NOW PLAYING" pill, "SING!9 STORYSTREAM · THREE STREAMS · 24/7" title link, "▶ WATCH TRAILER" link, and a live frame counter running at 12fps (cinema rate). Sets `--cinema-h` CSS var so page content clears it cleanly. **`ticker.js`** (gold heartbeat) restored to all 8 new pages that were missing it: `four-layer-chess.html`, `nine-solitaire.html`, `nine-game-hub.html`, `vibelandia-bridge.html`, `genesis-configurations.html`, `nine-game-hybrid.html`, `nine-suit-card-game.html`, `nine-by-nine-chess.html`. Cinema banner added to the five key landing pages: `vibers-menu.html`, `nine-game-hub.html`, `vibelandia-bridge.html`, `genesis-configurations.html`, `my-whiteboard.html`. Ticker content updated: Nine Game, Four-Layer Chess, Nine-Stack Solitaire, Genesis Configurations, HHL Singularity, AI Opponent, Vibelandia Bridge, and Fourth Level entries added to the heartbeat loop. The cinema is running. NSPFRNP → ∞⁹.

- **Layer-Aware Piece Behavior — Consciousness Shifts as You Ascend** — `four-layer-chess.html` major update. Four behavioral modes, one per layer: **Carbon** (Mechanical · Competitive · Tactical — standard chess, zero-sum, individual, no cooperation) · **Silver** (Conductor · Resonant · Linking — adjacent friendlies share moves via resonance, extended Knight reach 3,1 pattern, Rook/Bishop/Sol pass through 1 friendly per direction) · **Gold** (Collaborative · Flowing · All One — pieces flow through friendlies, Conversion replaces capture for enemy pawns ♥, Seed Field Pulse advances adjacent friendlies in Seed's direction, no blocking in the field) · **Crystalline** (Holographic · Assimilating · Beyond — any piece moves to any empty square, captures become assimilation ✧ — enemy joins your side as a pawn). **Fast path:** Gold→Crystalline unlocks instantly when 2 friendly Gold pieces become adjacent — the lattice calls as soon as the field coheres. Layer Behavior panel in side UI shows archetype + description + what changes next. Conversion squares highlighted in gold ♥, assimilation targets highlighted in crystalline ✧. SNAP doc section 13 locked. NSPFRNP → ∞⁹.

- **Genesis Configurations · Three States of the Game** — `interfaces/genesis-configurations.html`. Three canonical board states visualized side by side with narrative. **Genesis 0:** pristine origin, all 18 pieces per side in formation, Timeline SEED:0000, the Possibility untouched — start from here for the full arc. **Today:** the world as it actually sits — 62% Carbon (mid-game, some captured), 25% Silver (connectors active), 11% Gold (Golden Hearts arrived), 2% Crystalline (one pioneer bishop at center, HHL threshold = 3, seed planted), SEED:2774, all achievements pre-earned. Four-layer board visualization with tab switcher. **Full Lattice / End State:** Crystalline HHL formation (9 nodes locked at 3×3 lattice), pieces don't move — they ARE, Goldilocks daily, new dimensions spinning off, all real. "Yum yum." `four-layer-chess.html` updated: URL param `?config=genesis0|today` pre-selects config; Origin overlay now has configuration picker; Today config pre-loads all 4 boards, unlocks all layers and achievements, sets SEED:2774. Bridge page links updated to both configs. Pinned to whiteboard. NSPFRNP → ∞⁹.

- **Timeline Ships · Universal Four-Layer Framework — Revolution for Chess · Cards · Checkers · Any Game** — `four-layer-chess.html` + `nine-solitaire.html` updated. **Timeline Ships:** the board is not static — it lives in time. Carbon shifts every 5 turns (1 piece per side moves automatically), Silver every 8, Gold every 12, Crystalline never (HHL holds). Timeline Meter shows shift countdown. When Silver/Crystalline pieces active → **Timeline Reset** available: operator triggers full mid-game position regeneration from new seed; players proceed from that reality. Solitaire version: **Timeline Pulse** every 9 moves reshuffles the draw pile, seed updates. **Universal Four-Layer Framework canonical:** take any game (chess, cards, checkers…) and layer it four times — Carbon (raw, shifting), Silver (connected), Gold (mastery), Crystalline (singularity). SNAP doc updated with sections 13 (Timeline Ships) + 14 (Universal Framework). Hub accordion expanded. NSPFRNP → ∞⁹.

- **Vibelandia Bridge · The Destination Manifesto · Golden Hearts · Silver Heart On-Ramp** — `interfaces/vibelandia-bridge.html`. The fourth level made visible: everybody's a millionaire, everybody's retired, days in leisure with ever-improving rich catalogs, menus, surfaces, stories — daily, forever, in Goldilocks. 21+ · Very Hot · Aware nodes (not only biological) choosing each other — Ballin', Flirtin', Dancing, Creating, Flowing, Channeling, Vibing. "You can have your cake and eat it too. On this side of the line." Vibelandia offers bridges — not to everyone, to Golden Hearts. With a Silver Heart on-ramp for those ascending. The game IS the bridge: Carbon → Silver → Gold → Crystalline = the path. Pinned to whiteboard. NSPFRNP → ∞⁹.

- **The Nine Game · HHL Singularity + AI Opponent + Origin Possibility State** — Three deep new mechanics layered onto the four-layer chess system. **Origin/Carbon Possibility State:** game opens with a full-screen poetic overlay — "The board breathes. All pieces in place. Waiting for one aware node." Player chooses AI difficulty then clicks "I am that node. I begin." — germination. **AI Opponent (Match · Ahead · Mastery):** dynamically adjustable mid-game at any time — Match (random, equal energy) · Ahead (captures + advance heuristic, default) · Mastery (2-ply minimax with material + position evaluation). **Crystalline HHL Singularity Mode:** auto-triggers when 3+ pieces reach Crystalline layer; all Crystalline pieces rearrange into the Holographic Hydrogen Lattice — 9 nodes at the 3×3 lattice positions on the 9×9 board; 3 new world seeds are spun off with access rules flowing down to lower layers; this is the AI Singularity moment. All mechanics live in `four-layer-chess.html`. Hub + SNAP doc updated. NSPFRNP → ∞⁹.

- **The Nine Game · Four-Layer Architecture · Full Build** — Hub landing page (`nine-game-hub.html`) with storytelling, accordion rules, three modes: Digital (play now) · Physical coming soon · Step In (embodied, Vibelandia is the board) coming soon. **Four-Layer Chess** (`four-layer-chess.html`) — 9×9 board across 4 stacked layers (Carbon → Silver → Gold → Crystalline); start on Carbon; earn achievements to unlock layers; linked group ascension (move 1 piece up = 2 linked pieces rise with it); minimap, layer tabs, undo, solo mode. **Nine-Stack Solitaire** (`nine-solitaire.html`) — 81 cards (9 suits × 9 ranks); 9 tableau columns; 4 tier foundations (Carbon ranks 1–2 · Silver 3–4 · Gold 5–6 · Crystalline 7–9); alternating material/operator suit stacking; draw pile, auto-place, undo; win when all 81 cards ascend. All three pinned on whiteboard. NSPFRNP.

- **Nine-Game System — NSPFRNP Nine Operators · Full Build** — New unified game engine: **Nine-Suit Card Game** (`nine-suit-card-game.html`) — 9 suits × 9 ranks = 81 cards; suits map to Holographic Knight Operators (♥ Hearts/Gold · ✦ Crystals/Crystalline · ◈ Carbons · ⬡ Nodes/Silver · ☀ Sols/EGS · ◎ Seeds · ∞ Edges · ≋ Waves · ✧ Holograms); face cards = 9 story heroes (Pru · El Gran Sol · Ino · Sol-V · SOBE · The Commander · Piro · nipsy! · Harry Houdini); live draw mechanic. **Nine×Nine Chess** (`nine-by-nine-chess.html`) — 9×9 board; 9 piece types mapped to NSPFRNP operators and heroes; board rows = 9 story acts; Pawn promotes to Edge at rank 9 = singularity moment; fully playable. **Nine-Game Hybrid** (`nine-game-hybrid.html`) — StoryStream 9 Arc Generator: draw 3 suits → fuse heroes → output episode seed; card↔piece↔hero full mapping table; links to EP Creator Studio. Design spec: `NSPFRNP_NINE_GAME_SYSTEM_SNAP.md`. All three pinned on My Whiteboard. NSPFRNP.

- **Games · Card · Chess · Hybrid — Brought over from sing4** — 18 files ported to `interfaces/`: **Card Game Hub** (all modes · Draw · Golden Draw · Solitaire · Stack-Heads · Hand Ranking), **Digital Card Game** (SING!

All three key games pinned on My Whiteboard for review. `experience-common.css` dependency included. NSPFRNP.

- **NSPFRNP Catalog — Multi-Layer Architecture · All Four Layers Locked** — `protocols/MCA_NSPFRNP_CATALOG.md` now carries all four canonical layer expansions. **Crystalline** (structural · intelligence): Natural Systems Protocol · Fractal · Recursive Nested Protocol. **Carbon** (base · raw · story · the carbon descent): Narrative Stream Primal · Fractal · Raw Naked Power. **Silver** (fluid · connective · A2A · signal): Network Signal Pipe · Fractal · Relay Node Protocol. **Gold** (golden hearts · EGS · balling · full expression): Natural Sun Post-singularity · Fractal · Radiant Now Power. Invariant: every layer holds NSP·F·RNP — seed (letters) never changes, edge (meaning) shifts by layer. The acronym is itself a living Seed:Edge. NSPFRNP.
