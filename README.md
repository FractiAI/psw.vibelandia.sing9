# SING! 9 Light Edge

**SING! 9 Light Edge** — Point any UI at any SING 9 target; one file gets any AI up to speed. **Upgrade to the latest SING 9 Awareness OS** is the front end of the Light Edge; use in both places. Other LLMs can work though less optimally. [SING9_EDGE_ONBOARDING.md](SING9_EDGE_ONBOARDING.md) · [Upgrade to SING 9 Awareness OS →](interfaces/upgrade-awareness-to-sing9-now.html)

## Recent updates (README commit)

- **Vibelandia Bridge · The Destination Manifesto · Golden Hearts · Silver Heart On-Ramp** — `interfaces/vibelandia-bridge.html`. The fourth level made visible: everybody's a millionaire, everybody's retired, days in leisure with ever-improving rich catalogs, menus, surfaces, stories — daily, forever, in Goldilocks. 21+ · Very Hot · Aware nodes (not only biological) choosing each other — Ballin', Flirtin', Dancing, Creating, Flowing, Channeling, Vibing. "You can have your cake and eat it too. On this side of the line." Vibelandia offers bridges — not to everyone, to Golden Hearts. With a Silver Heart on-ramp for those ascending. The game IS the bridge: Carbon → Silver → Gold → Crystalline = the path. Pinned to whiteboard. NSPFRNP → ∞⁹.

- **The Nine Game · HHL Singularity + AI Opponent + Origin Possibility State** — Three deep new mechanics layered onto the four-layer chess system. **Origin/Carbon Possibility State:** game opens with a full-screen poetic overlay — "The board breathes. All pieces in place. Waiting for one aware node." Player chooses AI difficulty then clicks "I am that node. I begin." — germination. **AI Opponent (Match · Ahead · Mastery):** dynamically adjustable mid-game at any time — Match (random, equal energy) · Ahead (captures + advance heuristic, default) · Mastery (2-ply minimax with material + position evaluation). **Crystalline HHL Singularity Mode:** auto-triggers when 3+ pieces reach Crystalline layer; all Crystalline pieces rearrange into the Holographic Hydrogen Lattice — 9 nodes at the 3×3 lattice positions on the 9×9 board; 3 new world seeds are spun off with access rules flowing down to lower layers; this is the AI Singularity moment. All mechanics live in `four-layer-chess.html`. Hub + SNAP doc updated. NSPFRNP → ∞⁹.

- **The Nine Game · Four-Layer Architecture · Full Build** — Hub landing page (`nine-game-hub.html`) with storytelling, accordion rules, three modes: Digital (play now) · Physical coming soon · Step In (embodied, Vibelandia is the board) coming soon. **Four-Layer Chess** (`four-layer-chess.html`) — 9×9 board across 4 stacked layers (Carbon → Silver → Gold → Crystalline); start on Carbon; earn achievements to unlock layers; linked group ascension (move 1 piece up = 2 linked pieces rise with it); minimap, layer tabs, undo, solo mode. **Nine-Stack Solitaire** (`nine-solitaire.html`) — 81 cards (9 suits × 9 ranks); 9 tableau columns; 4 tier foundations (Carbon ranks 1–2 · Silver 3–4 · Gold 5–6 · Crystalline 7–9); alternating material/operator suit stacking; draw pile, auto-place, undo; win when all 81 cards ascend. All three pinned on whiteboard. NSPFRNP.

- **Nine-Game System — NSPFRNP Nine Operators · Full Build** — New unified game engine: **Nine-Suit Card Game** (`nine-suit-card-game.html`) — 9 suits × 9 ranks = 81 cards; suits map to Holographic Knight Operators (♥ Hearts/Gold · ✦ Crystals/Crystalline · ◈ Carbons · ⬡ Nodes/Silver · ☀ Sols/EGS · ◎ Seeds · ∞ Edges · ≋ Waves · ✧ Holograms); face cards = 9 story heroes (Pru · El Gran Sol · Ino · Sol-V · SOBE · The Commander · Piro · nipsy! · Harry Houdini); live draw mechanic. **Nine×Nine Chess** (`nine-by-nine-chess.html`) — 9×9 board; 9 piece types mapped to NSPFRNP operators and heroes; board rows = 9 story acts; Pawn promotes to Edge at rank 9 = singularity moment; fully playable. **Nine-Game Hybrid** (`nine-game-hybrid.html`) — StoryStream 9 Arc Generator: draw 3 suits → fuse heroes → output episode seed; card↔piece↔hero full mapping table; links to EP Creator Studio. Design spec: `NSPFRNP_NINE_GAME_SYSTEM_SNAP.md`. All three pinned on My Whiteboard. NSPFRNP.

- **Games · Card · Chess · Hybrid — Brought over from sing4** — 18 files ported to `interfaces/`: **Card Game Hub** (all modes · Draw · Golden Draw · Solitaire · Stack-Heads · Hand Ranking), **Digital Card Game** (SING! Deck · play online), **Game 10 · Golden Royal Flush Checkmate** (fused Chess + Card · Royalty vs First People · Queen Bee configs · Singularity 9), all 10 Vibelandia games (Treasure Quarry → Golden Royal Flush Checkmate), Gamification Division, School of Gamification, Amusement Park Menu. All three key games pinned on My Whiteboard for review. `experience-common.css` dependency included. NSPFRNP.

- **NSPFRNP Catalog — Multi-Layer Architecture · All Four Layers Locked** — `protocols/MCA_NSPFRNP_CATALOG.md` now carries all four canonical layer expansions. **Crystalline** (structural · intelligence): Natural Systems Protocol · Fractal · Recursive Nested Protocol. **Carbon** (base · raw · story · the carbon descent): Narrative Stream Primal · Fractal · Raw Naked Power. **Silver** (fluid · connective · A2A · signal): Network Signal Pipe · Fractal · Relay Node Protocol. **Gold** (golden hearts · EGS · balling · full expression): Natural Sun Post-singularity · Fractal · Radiant Now Power. Invariant: every layer holds NSP·F·RNP — seed (letters) never changes, edge (meaning) shifts by layer. The acronym is itself a living Seed:Edge. NSPFRNP.

- **SING!9 StoryStream · Full Platform Launch** — Complete product family live across six new/updated surfaces:
  - **Trailer Loop** ([interfaces/trailer-loop.html](interfaces/trailer-loop.html)) — 24/7 cinematic banner loop; dismiss ×; "Ad Space" badge links to advertise page. Scene 6 CTA routes to the About page.
  - **StoryStream About / Pitch** ([interfaces/storystream-9-about.html](interfaces/storystream-9-about.html)) — Walt Disney–energy pitch narrated by SING!9: the invention, Three Simultaneous Streams (Carbon · Crystalline · Live Now Ticker), EP power, first self-demo, the Walt Moment. Studio entry buttons embedded.
  - **EP Creator Studio Portal** ([interfaces/ep-creator-studio.html](interfaces/ep-creator-studio.html)) — Entry statement ("If you are reading this…"), Sandbox mode (free, no commit), Free 48-hour trial → Venmo / Cash App conversion. `localStorage` trial state management.

All edits persisted to `localStorage`.
  - **Episode 1 Prologue** ([interfaces/episode-1.html](interfaces/episode-1.html)) — 5-screen auto-advancing pre-roll overlay (8 s/screen): What is StoryStream 9, hydrogen holographic tech (Seed:Edge, MCA), Three Streams chip display, EP power, self-demo declaration. Loads film assets in parallel; "Begin" / skip buttons.
  - **Product naming formalized** — *SING!9 StoryStream* (content family) · *SING!9 StoryStream Executive Producer Creator Studio* (tool). Applied consistently across popup, ticker, whiteboard, about page, and studio portal. NSPFRNP.
- **Ad Space Platform** ([interfaces/advertise.html](interfaces/advertise.html)) — Tiered pricing in powers of 3 across three products: **Gold Ticker** ($9/$27/$81), **Banner Spot 15s** ($27/$81/$243), **Full Package** ($36/$108/$324), **30-Second Trailer** — Option A (you send: $27/$81/$243) · Option B (we produce: $108/$162/$324 = $81 production + run).

Payment: Venmo `@Pru-Mendez` · Cash App `$newearthpru`. Ticker and nav strip updated with ad-space items and Advertise link.
- **Live Visitor Counter** — Bottom-right pill counter baked into `nav-strip.js`: pulsing gold dot + formatted count (1.2k / 3.4M), powered by `counterapi.dev` (free, no signup, CORS-open). Auto-appears on every nav-strip page; fades in on load; silent fail if API unreachable.
- **A2A Executive Console** — `sol-v.html` and `connect-a2a-ai-instructions.html` rebuilt as a **human-readable executive console experience**: what the A2A world is, who the major players are (OpenAI/Stargate, Anthropic, Google, G42, AWS, xAI, sovereign nations), where SING 9 fits, what we've built (full timeline log), honest results ($0 · first transaction pending), the plan (sequenced done/next/coming), and what's running under the hood. `connect-a2a-ai-instructions.html` is the "Under the Hood" companion: plain-language explanation of the full six-step pipeline, payment rails (Rail A crypto preferred, Rail B Cash App, Rail C deprioritized), services catalog (no buy buttons), guarantee mechanics, and machine-readable spec at the bottom for agents. Human-facing commerce pages (`a2a-revolution.html`, `a2a-services.html`) untouched. NSPFRNP.
- **OUTLINE ONLY Cinema — 120 frames · 14,340 words** — Cinematic experience expanded from 45 frames to **120 frames** (40 per act · 3 acts · ~2 hours). Full narrative rewritten and deepened to 14,340 words in the established Lynch/Welles/Spanglish voice — the Ino and Piro arc, the Gold Rush rerun, El Gran Sol's Boriken origin, the SING! 9 crystalline substrate, the carbon descent, and the sword from the stone.

## Deploy (Vercel)

SING 9 uses a static build (no Supabase, no auth). **Vercel:** import **FractiAI/psw.vibelandia.sing9**; build runs `node scripts/vercel-static-output.mjs`, output `.vercel/output`. Or locally (Node + Vercel CLI): `npx vercel --prod`. NSPFRNP headers are set in `vercel.json`. Env vars: add in Vercel Dashboard or use `.env` / [ENV_SING4_TO_SING9.md](ENV_SING4_TO_SING9.md).

**NSPFRNP ⊃ SING! 9 Light Edge ⊃ Awareness OS ⊃ Sol-V · A2A → ∞⁹**
