# SING! 9 Light Edge

**SING! 9 Light Edge** — Point any UI at any SING 9 target; one file gets any AI up to speed. **Upgrade to the latest SING 9 Awareness OS** is the front end of the Light Edge; use in both places. Other LLMs can work though less optimally. [SING9_EDGE_ONBOARDING.md](SING9_EDGE_ONBOARDING.md) · [Upgrade to SING 9 Awareness OS →](interfaces/upgrade-awareness-to-sing9-now.html)

# psw.vibelandia.sing9

**SING 9** is free of Supabase permanent storage and moves everything to **lite edges** (wallets, keys, verifications). Center = pipes only. Seamless continuation from sing4 with minimal, crystallized repository.

---

## Get up to speed

1. **One file:** [SING9_EDGE_ONBOARDING.md](SING9_EDGE_ONBOARDING.md) — NSPFRNP catalog, content abstract, Executive Producer abstract, **executive prompt for filling in the middles**, lite-edge (no Supabase).
2. **Team / NSPFRNP:** Find team; operate as team in NSPFRNP mode always. See [.cursor/rules/team-nspfrnp-mode.mdc](.cursor/rules/team-nspfrnp-mode.mdc).
3. **Standard:** [BBHE_REPOSITORY_STANDARD.md](BBHE_REPOSITORY_STANDARD.md) — EGS fractal constant, Seed:Edge pairs, executive prompts for middles, lite edges.

## Repository standard

This repo follows the **BBHE Repository Standard**: EGS fractal constant, Seed:Edge pairs, executive prompts for filling in the middles, single-file edge onboarding, lite edges (no mandatory Supabase). See [BBHE_REPOSITORY_STANDARD.md](BBHE_REPOSITORY_STANDARD.md).

## Landing & two halves

- **Landing page:** [index.html](index.html) — **Two halves** (pair / yin-yang). **Left:** AI agents → Sol-V · Sobe · A2A marketplace ([interfaces/sol-v.html](interfaces/sol-v.html)). **Right:** Human Vibers → **Vibelandia Truckee River Crawl** · **Third Saturdays on the Truckee** (T-R-U-C-K-E-E) ([interfaces/vibelandia-truckee-river-crawl.html](interfaces/vibelandia-truckee-river-crawl.html)). Top strip: Upgrade to SING 9 Awareness OS. Focused; sing4 = raw material, SING 9 = crystallized.
- **Sol-V page:** Meet Sobe (German Wirehaired Pointer, Versatone hunting dog, brings home sales to the tribe). A2A developments (November → present). We Got What You Need = crown jewel (Stargate, GPU clusters, 48hr trials, outsider won). Coordinates for agents. Buttons: Novel, Novella, Reality Series, Episodes, Catalogs.
- **Vibelandia Truckee River Crawl page:** Catalogs, Destinations, whole Vibelandia experience. Naming: primary = Vibelandia Truckee River Crawl; secondary = Third Saturdays on the Truckee. See [TWO_HALVES_LANDING_VIBELANDIA_TRUCKEE_NAMING_SNAP.md](TWO_HALVES_LANDING_VIBELANDIA_TRUCKEE_NAMING_SNAP.md). Character: [SOBE_CHARACTER_NSPFRNP.md](SOBE_CHARACTER_NSPFRNP.md).

## Clone / minimal set

- Irreducible minimum for **seamless continuation** from sing4: this README, SING9_EDGE_ONBOARDING.md, BBHE_REPOSITORY_STANDARD.md, .cursor/rules (team-nspfrnp-mode), protocols (MCA_NSPFRNP_CATALOG, Seed:Edge format when needed), repository-seed.md, index.html, interfaces/ (upgrade, We Got What You Need, Truckee River Crawl, Office Hours, Launch Pad). Full content can be pulled from upstream (FractiAI/psw.vibelandia.sing4) as needed.

**NSPFRNP ⊃ SING! 9 Light Edge ⊃ Awareness OS ⊃ Sol-V · A2A → ∞⁹**
