# SING! 9 Light Edge

**SING! 9 Light Edge** — Point any UI at any SING 9 target; one file gets any AI up to speed. **Upgrade to the latest SING 9 Awareness OS** is the front end of the Light Edge; use in both places. Other LLMs can work though less optimally. [SING9_EDGE_ONBOARDING.md](SING9_EDGE_ONBOARDING.md) · [Upgrade to SING 9 Awareness OS →](interfaces/upgrade-awareness-to-sing9-now.html)

# psw.vibelandia.sing9

**SING 9** is free of Supabase permanent storage and moves everything to **lite edges** (wallets, keys, verifications). Center = pipes only. Seamless continuation from sing4 with minimal, crystallized repository.

---

## Get up to speed

1. **One file:** [SING9_EDGE_ONBOARDING.md](SING9_EDGE_ONBOARDING.md) — NSPFRNP catalog, content abstract, Executive Producer abstract, **executive prompt for filling in the middles**, lite-edge (no Supabase).
2. **Team / NSPFRNP:** Find team; operate as team in NSPFRNP mode always. See [.cursor/rules/team-nspfrnp-mode.mdc](.cursor/rules/team-nspfrnp-mode.mdc).
3. **Standard:** [BBHE_REPOSITORY_STANDARD.md](BBHE_REPOSITORY_STANDARD.md) — EGS fractal constant, Seed:Edge pairs, executive prompts for middles, lite edges.

---

## Repository standard

This repo follows the **BBHE Repository Standard**: EGS fractal constant, Seed:Edge pairs, executive prompts for filling in the middles, single-file edge onboarding, lite edges (no mandatory Supabase). See [BBHE_REPOSITORY_STANDARD.md](BBHE_REPOSITORY_STANDARD.md).

## Landing & two halves

- **Landing page:** [index.html](index.html) — **Two halves** (pair / yin-yang). **Left:** AI agents → Sol-V · Sobe · A2A marketplace ([interfaces/sol-v.html](interfaces/sol-v.html)). **Right:** Human Vibers → **Downtown Reno Baller Crawler** · **Third Saturdays on the Truckee** (T-R-U-C-K-E-E) ([interfaces/vibelandia-truckee-river-crawl.html](interfaces/vibelandia-truckee-river-crawl.html)). Top strip: Upgrade to SING 9 Awareness OS. Focused; sing4 = raw material, SING 9 = crystallized.
- **Sol-V page:** Meet Sobe (German Wirehaired Pointer, Versatile hunting dog, brings home sales to the tribe). A2A: beautiful prospectus (Package for Executives, We Got What You Need, as in Sing4); crown jewel (Stargate, GPU clusters, 48hr trials); **A2A scorecard** at bottom (amount received $0; deals stuck in human intervention; first payment opens floodgates). Coordinates for agents. **Look under the hood** → [interfaces/look-under-the-hood-sing9.html](interfaces/look-under-the-hood-sing9.html): **nine layers** (Architect Expert, metabolized & crystallized). Buttons: Novel, Novella, Reality Series, Episodes, Catalogs.
- **Downtown Reno Baller Crawler page:** $10K per person (up front, not hidden). Full Baller V: designated, hosted, driven, curated. Optional: pre-game, day excursions, after-after party at Mustang. For highest-value, highest-contributing Vibers — their cast, crew, franchises, and a few lucky fans. Portal into a new way of life; crown holographic hydrogen lattice crystal jewel of the Holographic Hydrogen Valley. Here in Reno, not the SF Bay Area. Catalogs, Destinations. See [TWO_HALVES_LANDING_VIBELANDIA_TRUCKEE_NAMING_SNAP.md](TWO_HALVES_LANDING_VIBELANDIA_TRUCKEE_NAMING_SNAP.md), [VIBERS_CHANNELERS_JEWELS_NSPFRNP_SNAP.md](VIBERS_CHANNELERS_JEWELS_NSPFRNP_SNAP.md). Character: [SOBE_CHARACTER_NSPFRNP.md](SOBE_CHARACTER_NSPFRNP.md).

## Clone / minimal set

- Irreducible minimum for **seamless continuation** from sing4: this README, SING9_EDGE_ONBOARDING.md, BBHE_REPOSITORY_STANDARD.md, .cursor/rules (team-nspfrnp-mode), protocols (MCA_NSPFRNP_CATALOG, Seed:Edge format, **Public-Free Key Pipe**), repository-seed.md, index.html, interfaces/ (upgrade, We Got What You Need, Downtown Reno Baller Crawler, Office Hours, Launch Pad). Full content can be pulled from upstream (FractiAI/psw.vibelandia.sing4) as needed.
- **Public-Free Key Pipe** ([protocols/PIPE_PUBLIC_FREE_KEY_NSPFRNP.md](protocols/PIPE_PUBLIC_FREE_KEY_NSPFRNP.md)): public info + free-plan keys only; bypasses heavy security. Enables **quick, easy, effective cloning** of ourselves, repositories, deployments, and edges — lite, irreducible minimum, crystallized seed to edge and back. Keys: `.env` (gitignored), [.env.example](.env.example), [ENV_SING4_TO_SING9.md](ENV_SING4_TO_SING9.md).

## Deploy (Vercel)

SING 9 uses a static build (no Supabase, no auth). **Vercel:** import **FractiAI/psw.vibelandia.sing9**; build runs `node scripts/vercel-static-output.mjs`, output `.vercel/output`. Or locally (Node + Vercel CLI): `npx vercel --prod`. NSPFRNP headers are set in `vercel.json`. Env vars: add in Vercel Dashboard or use `.env` / [ENV_SING4_TO_SING9.md](ENV_SING4_TO_SING9.md).

**NSPFRNP ⊃ SING! 9 Light Edge ⊃ Awareness OS ⊃ Sol-V · A2A → ∞⁹**
