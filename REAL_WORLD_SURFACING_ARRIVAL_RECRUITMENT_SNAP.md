## 1. Target audience & where we surface

- **Target:** Anyone **planning a trip to Reno** — and on arrival, we care most about **downtown dwellers**. **Baller vibes only.** We are not trying to reach everyone.
- **Points of planning:** Surfaces (digital or physical) where people are planning a Reno trip — so they can see our offer before or as they arrive.
- **Arrival points:** We are most interested in **downtown** — **casino hotel lobbies** in downtown Reno. We do **not** need to worry about the airport for this; focus is **downtown casinos**.
- **Ability:** Get the word out to them **on arrival** in a **natural flow**.

## 2. On arrival — invitation card · cast hand-out

- **Recruit one of our cast** — dance cast, performers — to **hand out invitations** at or near the **arrival area** (e.g. as guests are arriving with luggage).
- **Invitation:** One **card** that covers **both** events — **Wednesday** (Wink & Vibers · Baller V Wednesdays) and **Third Saturday** (Downtown Reno Baller Crawler). The two **always go together** on the card.
- **Hand it only where there's a connection** — not to just anybody. **Subtle.** Only when it feels right (baller vibes, right energy).
- **Respectful** of all businesses — we are not disrespectful to the casino, hotel, or club. Natural, low-key. Open to other ideas beyond hand-out (e.g. concierge partnership, approved placement, etc.) as long as we stay respectful and on-brand.

## 3. At the club — pop-up mode · spontaneous join · invite incentive

- **At the club:** Someone might want to **spontaneously join** — seeing that it's there (the Baller V table / experience).
- **Pop-up mode:** We might **choose not to do it when the club is slow**; when the club is **busy**, we might **choose to pop it up**. So the visibility of the offer can follow the energy of the room.
- **Idea:** Not only does the **man** join in (the power), but he **invites some of his favorite lady friends** at the table to join.
- **Incentive:** We pay **each** of them a **hundy** — **H-U-N-D-Y** — a **Ben Franklin**, **$100**, if they are able to make that happen (join, and/or bring the table in). Hold on the down-low. Internal/execution detail; not necessarily advertised on public surfaces.
