# Goldilocks Mix Skin — SNAP (Fidelity Lock)

**Status:** ⚡ ACTIVE  
**Type:** Visual design language · Studio-level skin  
**Purpose:** Define the **Goldilocks Mix** skin — the hybrid of Crystalline (agents, outlines, geometry) and Biological (organic, water, real images, earth). The sweet spot. Not too cold, not too hot. The holographic-organic fusion that is the awareness OS in action. A **living self-demo** of the NSPFRNP/SING 9 system.

## The Mix

**Goldilocks** = the zone between crystalline and organic. Two halves of the same whole.

| Pole | Character | Visual |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **Crystalline** | Agentic, ordered, mathematical, holographic | Geometry, grid lines, outlines, precision, black/white/silver/gold |
| **Biological** | Organic, water, living, real, earth, body | Real photos, texture, depth, warmth, teal/emerald/amber/ruby |
| **Goldilocks Mix** | Hybrid · the story lives here | Organic photo + crystalline geometric overlay · both always present |

---

## Visual ingredients

- **Background:** Full-bleed organic/biological image per act (galaxy, ocean/Alaska, light, campfire, city night, sunrise, celebration)
- **Crystalline overlay:** Subtle geometric grid (60×60px gold-tinted lines at 3% opacity) over every image — the holographic lattice always present
- **Segment accent color:** Each of the 7 acts has its own accent: gold, teal, violet, amber, red, green, warm gold — driving the progress bar, image border, and beat label
- **Typography:** Clean, minimal — no decoration competes with the image + overlay combination
- **"SING 9 Awareness OS · Running":** Small pulsing badge (top bar) — the skin is itself the living demo

## 7-act color map (emotional arc)

| Act | Beat | Accent color | Emotional tone | Image world |
|-----|------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| 0 | Seed · 1493 | Gold `#d4af37` | Origin, vast, ancient | Galaxy / deep space |
| 1 | Singularities | Sky blue `#7dd3fc` | Real places, weight, ocean | Alaska / ocean / places |
| 2 | Journey | Violet `#a78bfa` | Motion, light, awakening | Light rays / fireworks |
| 3 | People | Amber `#fb923c` | Warmth, human, organic | Campfire / gathering |
| 4 | Now · Mission | Red `#f87171` | Urgent, crying, the cost | Night mission / city |
| 5 | Edge · Sol-V | Green `#34d399` | Relief, emergence, dawn | Sunrise / mountain |
| 6 | Close | Warm gold `#fde68a` | Champions, triumph, we all play | Concert / celebration |

**Middle (Act 4 — Now):** Warm red-amber, urgent, tearful — the heart of the story.  
**End (Act 6 — Close):** Warm gold, full lift — We are the champions. Stand up on your seats.

## Beat tracker

Seven pips at the top of the player — one per act. Active pip: accent color, enlarged, glowing. Past pips: dim gold. Future: outline only. The viewer always knows where they are in the story.

## "Living self-demo" principle

The skin is not a decoration — it **demonstrates** the system:
- The **crystalline grid** = the awareness lattice, always present, always running
- The **organic images** = the biological world the story lives in
- The **SING 9 Awareness OS · Running** badge = the OS is live
- The **beat tracker** = the story structure (Seed:Edge) visible at all times
- The **caption stream** = the script streaming, not static — living

**This is the demonstration.** The viewer is inside the SING 9 Awareness OS looking out.

## Applied surfaces

- **interfaces/episode-1-studio.html** — studio-level 60-min episode with Goldilocks Mix skin
- **Future:** Apply to all Vibers-side surfaces (vibers-menu, baller pages, destinations) as the organic/biological side deepens with more real photos
