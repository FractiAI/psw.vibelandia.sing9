# Surfaces & Content — SING4 Reference (Confirmation)

**Status:** ⚡ ACTIVE  
**Purpose:** Confirm surfaces and content sourced from FractiAI/psw.vibelandia.sing4 for seamless continuation into SING 9.

## Confirmation

All **surfaces and content** for SING 9 are **sourced from or aligned with** the sing4 repository (https://github.com/FractiAI/psw.vibelandia.sing4). Sing9 maintains:

- **NSPFRNP Catalog** (MCA, Seed:Edge, close ∞⁹) — from protocols/MCA_NSPFRNP_CATALOG.md, SEED_EDGE_EPISODE_FORMAT, sing4.
- **Team / NSPFRNP mode** — from .cursor/rules/team-nspfrnp-mode.mdc, TEAM_* docs, sing4.
- **Content catalog** — series, novels, surfaces, Office Hours, Launch Pad, Net episodes, EL APAGÓN, 2-7-9, nipsy!, Seed:Edge Action!, etc. — as defined in sing4 README and CONTENT_SERIES_*.
- **Featured campaigns (landing):**
  - **We Got What You Need** — AI Data Centers & Clusters (WE_GOT_WHAT_YOU_NEED_CAMPAIGN_AI_DATA_CENTERS_CLUSTERS_SNAP.md, interfaces/we-got-what-you-need-campaign.html).
  - **Ultimate Baller V Downtown Reno Baller Crawler** — Third Saturday on the River (ULTIMATE_BALLER_V_TRUCKEE_RIVER_CRAWL_SNAP.md, interfaces/ultimate-baller-v-truckee-river-crawl.html).
- **Upgrade flow** — Upgrade my awareness to SING 9 now → **SING 9 Awareness OS** (interfaces/upgrade-awareness-to-sing9-now.html, UPGRADE_AWARENESS_TO_SING9_NOW_BUTTON_AND_PAGE_SNAP.md).
- **What's New in SING 9** — block/section for Singularity, Vibers, onboarding, OS framing; loaded at top of landing and key interfaces (interfaces/whats-new-sing9.html / inject).
- **A2A (agent-to-agent)** — bidding and closing deals as described in sing4; SING 9 agent identity **Sol-V** (Base V, Space V) carries this.
- **Voice:** Spanglish 80/20 and fusions already defined in NSPFRNP; we continue. See ALL_CONTENT_80_ENGLISH_20_SPANISH_SPANGLISH_CONFIRMATION_SNAP.md (sing4).

Full interface list (175+ surfaces) lives in sing4 `interfaces/`; sing9 deploys the **irreducible minimum plus landing-focused set** (index, upgrade, We Got What You Need, Downtown Reno Baller Crawler, What's New). Additional surfaces can be copied from upstream as needed.
