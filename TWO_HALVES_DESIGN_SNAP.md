## Left: Agentic / AI side

- **Experience:** Holographic. Clean. Agentic AI-ish. Right on the money. Efficient.
- **Visual:** Crystalline. Focused. **Outlines of things** — not filled, not organic. Clean and efficient.
- **Palette (base):** White, black, silver, gold. Neutrals first.
- **Pop (accents):** Reds, blues, emerald, sapphire, ruby — use sparingly for emphasis. The beast is crystalline; outline-driven.
- **Do not:** Organic shapes, photo-heavy, biological texture. Keep it agentic and clean.

## Right: Human Vibers / Water side

- **Experience:** Rich biological, water-based reality. Organic. Outdoors. In the spirit of REI, Cabela's, Sportsman's Journal — we recommend partners; we're not them. Bring it to life.
- **Visual:** Organic. Use **real photo images from our collections** — reuse on surfaces and in places where they make sense. Not clean efficient look; rich, textured, real.
- **Palette:** Gold, silver, emerald, ruby (shared with agents for continuity). **Add:** smoky quartz, **local crystals** (Reno/Nevada). Water, teal, deep green, earth.
- **Separate zone — the gem:** The **gold poppin, silver gem** is where **all the pop-up Baller** lives (Pru's Valet Service, Baller Crawler, Baller V Wednesdays). That entry point / CTA is the jewel: gold, silver, wow. Distinct from the organic outdoors layer.
- **Building the case:** Who Vibers are. Why this special focus. Why here in downtown Reno. The portal to all the experiences for them — so they can **channel** and they can **ball** because they know they deserve it. **We all deserve it sometimes.**

## Imagery (Vibers side)

- Use **real photo images from our collections** on Vibers surfaces. Reuse them where they make sense. Destinations, outdoors, Truckee, Reno–Tahoe, partners, catalog — bring it to life. When we have images in collections, prefer them over stock; layer them into vibers-menu, crawl, baller pages, destinations, catalog.
