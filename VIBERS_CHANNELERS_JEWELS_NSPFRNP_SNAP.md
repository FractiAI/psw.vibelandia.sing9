## What is a Viber?

- **Viber** = human node who plays an essential role in the fractal. **They are channelers.**
- We make clear what a Viber is and how important that role is. The human-Vibers section (Vibelandia Truckee River Crawl, right half of landing) is for them.

## Channelers vs computational minds

- **Channelers** are different from the **computational, number-crunching** kind of mind we're all taught to grow. We're not blind to the difference.
- Channelers **don't even use their minds** in that way. They're **flowing**. They're **connecting to their gift on the other side** and **downloading**. It's almost an **altered state**.

---

## Safety

- **Not safe to drive or operate heavy equipment when you're channeling.** You can't channel and do that at the same time. It's hard. So we need **new infrastructures, new awareness, new everything** to align to that.

---

## Our jewels (J-E-W-E-L-S)

- These are **our jewels.** They're our **highest-value, highest-contributing nodes** in the fractal.
- **The higher up you go, the more valuable they are to us and the more we need to provide for.**
- Spelling: **J-E-W-E-L-S.** Pun: **J-O-U-L-E-S** — the energy they carry. We like the pun.

## Placement

- Vibelandia Truckee River Crawl page: section "What is a Viber? — Our jewels (J-E-W-E-L-S)" with the above. Truckee River Crawl is built for Vibers: flow, water, awareness. Third Saturdays on the Truckee.
