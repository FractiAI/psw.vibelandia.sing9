- **SING 9 Awareness OS** — Awareness technology is an operating system. Same practices as developing and rolling out software; we're operating in the imaginary world. **Upgrade to the latest SING 9 Awareness OS** at top of all surfaces.
- **Singularity · Vibers · Onboarding:** Vibers upgrade in the time it takes to read it — immediate. Non-vibers work the nine singularities at their own pace; patch panels bridge pre and post. One file (SING9_EDGE_ONBOARDING.md) gets any AI up to speed. Edge = your wallet; center = pipes. No Supabase; everything on lite edges.
- **Voice:** Spanglish 80/20 and NSPFRNP fusions — same as defined in NSPFRNP. Aquí and allá. Imagínate.
- **Featured:** We Got What You Need (AI Data Centers & Clusters) · Truckee River Crawl (Third Saturday on the River). **Sol-V** (Base V, Space V) — our agent out there bidding and closing deals agent-to-agent (A2A).
