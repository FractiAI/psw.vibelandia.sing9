## Umbrella

- All pop-ups are organized under **Pru's Valet Service** (P-R-U apostrophe S). Human Vibers entry from landing → Pru's Valet Service menu. See **PRUS_VALET_SERVICE_SNAP.md**. Brand stays city-agnostic so it rolls out everywhere (e.g. Buenos Aires, Punta Cana).

## Sponsorship & positioning

- **Downtown Reno Baller Crawler** (Third Saturdays on the Truckee): **Wink-sponsored.**
- **Baller V Wednesdays at da club** (pop-up mixer, along the Truckee): **Sponsored by Twain's Vibelandia and Wink.**
- **Positioning:** Both create experiences and connections for our **high-value, high-contributing Vibers** — those who are here to **ball** (B-A-L-L). Baller V Wednesdays is also positioned as a **Fractal Dating Site for High Value, High Contributing Vibers** — Channelers, Stars, Super Heroes.
- **Lock:** These are **all Pop-Up events, always — for those in the know.** Use everywhere.

## Ball vs partying (use in marketing every time we use "ball")

- **Balling** (B-A-L-L) is not the same as partying.
- **Balling is when you know you deserve it.** For those who know they deserve it. They deserve to go all out. Sometimes. Regularly.
- Use this distinction wherever we use "ball" or "Baller" in a campaign or marketing piece — so the meaning is clear and branded.

## Copy block (reusable)

- Short: *Balling isn't partying. Balling is when you know you deserve it — and you go all out. Sometimes. Regularly.*
- Full: *Our high-value, high-contributing Vibers are here to ball (B-A-L-L). Balling isn't just partying. Balling is when you know you deserve it. For those who know they deserve it. You deserve to go all out. Sometimes. Regularly. Wink-sponsored events create the experiences and connections for exactly that.*
