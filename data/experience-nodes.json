  "title": "SING 9 · Experience Node Architecture",
  "last_updated": "2026-02-16",
  "philosophy": "Disney and Hollywood approach storytelling in SCENES. SING 9 approaches storytelling in EXPERIENCES. The experience is the SING 9 node. Each node is a complete world — a 4-Oh theater — with all its layers active simultaneously. Not a movie you watch. A world you enter.",

  "node_structure": {
    "level_0_container": {
      "name": "The SING 9 Node",
      "description": "The experience node is the fundamental unit of SING 9 content delivery. One node = one complete world. Nested nodes are possible — a node can contain nodes. The smallest node is a 30-second trading card frame. The largest is a 60-minute episode. The structure is fractal: same architecture at every scale.",
      "analogy": "Think of a Disney theme park as one node. The Magic Kingdom is a node. But each land inside it is also a node. And each ride inside that is also a node. SING 9 works the same way — you can zoom in or zoom out, the structure is the same."
    },

    "level_1_theater": {
      "name": "The 4-Oh Theater",
      "description": "The immersive container. The 4-Oh theater wraps every experience in a complete sensory environment — visual surfaces, audio score, the world it's placed in. The '4-Oh' is the fourth dimension of experience: not just sight, sound, and space, but TIME — the experience knows where it is in the story arc.",
      "components": {
        "skins": "The visual surface layer. Every node has a default skin and a library of alternate skins. Skins can be swapped — changing the time period, the dimension, the cultural wrapper — without changing the story underneath. The geometry is constant. The skin changes.",
        "surfaces": "The rendered presentation layer. What the viewer actually sees on their device or in their space. SING 9 surfaces are pre-rendered and instantly accessible — no build wait.",
        "world": "The narrative world the node is placed in — the Vibelandia world, the Alaska world, the 1493 world, the post-singularity world. The world sets the physics and social rules of the experience."
      }
    },

    "level_2_sets_and_scenes": {
      "name": "Sets and Scenes",
      "description": "The physical and visual space within the 4-Oh theater. Sets are the locations — Reno downtown, Kachemak Bay, the sacred bay, the DJ station. Scenes are the specific arrangements within the set. Sets and scenes are interchangeable across nodes — the same set can hold different stories; the same story can run in different sets.",
      "mix_and_match_rule": "Any set can hold any story. Any scene can be relocated to any world. The set is a costume for the story, not the story itself."
    },

    "level_3_story": {
      "name": "The Story",
      "description": "Nested within the set. Every SING 9 story has the same underlying cast. The wrapper changes — the cast structure never does.",
      "cast_structure": {
        "ino_the_innocent": {
          "role": "The gold heart. The protagonist. The pure. Always present, always the center. Can wear any wrapper — the dog, the surfer, the hunter, any historical hero. The wrapper is the skin; Ino is the soul.",
          "story_function": "Everything in the story is organized around protecting, liberating, or celebrating Ino."
        },
        "piro_the_pirate": {
          "role": "The antagonist. The disingenuous. The carbon heart. Also always present. Not pure evil — a compromised being who made wrong choices under pressure.",
          "story_function": "Creates the friction that gives the story meaning. Never defeated with violence — the tide turns and Piro is left on dry sand."
        },
        "fanny_the_fan": {
          "role": "The fans. Pre-singularity: mostly Piro's fans. Post-singularity: redirected toward Ino. The social community. The tipping point.",
          "story_function": "Marks the social turning point. When enough Audi becomes Fanny, the story reaches its resolution."
        },
        "audi_the_audience": {
          "role": "The complacent, uninspired observers. Not active enemies — tuned out of the storytelling deliberately. Their passive weight creates tension without requiring villain engagement.",
          "story_function": "Provides the social resistance without creating a war. The story doesn't fight Audi — it moves through it."
        },
        "active_enemies_note": "Active enemies are DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED from the storytelling. They are tuned out. The complacent Audi observers are sufficient weight to create the tension the story needs. No need for an active villain. The pirate is enough. Everything else is noise — and we don't broadcast noise."
      }

    "level_4_live_now": {
      "name": "Live Now Broadcast",
      "description": "The front stage. The radio broadcast, live. This is what is happening RIGHT NOW in the node — the current act of the story, the current interaction between Ino and Piro and Fanny and Audi. The front console view. The center of the dashboard.",
      "components": {

Each deck can swap the dimension, the time period, the cultural wrapper, the world of the story — without changing the underlying narrative geometry. Examples: the 1493 deck, the post-singularity deck, the Montana deck, the Caribbean deck, the corporate boardroom deck, the underwater deck.",
          "mix_rule": "Any surface deck can be applied to any story. Cacique's return story can run in a Montana skin. The cat-and-dog story can run in a boardroom skin. The geometry is the story. The surface is the costume."

          "description": "The mysterious watcher. Glasses and a hat. Unknown identity — deliberately unknown. Shows up at key moments. Never speaks. Just seen. The gentle signal that something significant just happened. The post-singularity equivalent of the studio audience 'APPLAUSE' sign — but elegant, subtle, unmistakable.",
          "function": "When the Wild Card Observer appears in a node, it signals to the attentive viewer: pay attention, something important just happened or is about to happen. Not explained. Not announced. Just: he's there. Then he's gone. That's enough.",
