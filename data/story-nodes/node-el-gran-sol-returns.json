When assembling this node for delivery, begin with SMACS 0723 in full silence, let the viewer settle into cosmic scale, then bring the piano in gently as the 1493 wound is shown. The return is unhurried — El Gran Sol has been waiting 530 years; he can take the time to do this right. The water scene gets its full weight. The rescue boat gets its full relief. The celebration does not rush. Big Papi pays the tab at the very end, and then Morning in Paradise plays, and the screen holds on the Reno golden sunset until the track finishes. That's it. That's the whole story. Everything else in the catalog is a chapter of this.",
