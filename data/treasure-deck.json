  "title": "The Treasure Deck · SING 9 Wild Card Treasures",
  "last_updated": "2026-02-16",
  "description": "The treasure deck is managed by the DJ at the DJ station. Treasures are wild card elements that can be inserted into any SING 9 experience node at any moment to enrich, surprise, gear-shift, or reward. They are not the main story — they are the bass drum. Boom. Boom. Boom. They keep the beat going. They keep the audience from falling asleep. They are the spice in the story's kitchen.",
  "rule": "Treasures are always: connection-based, respect-based, and earned. None of the bad ones — we know which ones those are. All of the good ones — we know which ones those are too.",
  "deployment": "The DJ deploys a treasure when: (1) the story needs a gear shift, (2) the pacing needs a wild card injection, (3) a reward has been earned by the story arc, or (4) the Wild Card Observer has appeared and the treasure follows his appearance.",
