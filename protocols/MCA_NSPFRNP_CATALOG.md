# MCA NSPFRNP Catalog — Canonical Definitions (Fidelity Lock)

**Protocol:** NSPFRNP  
**Catalog:** MCA (Metabolize → Crystallize → Animate)  
**Purpose:** Lock canonical definitions so fidelity is not lost.  
**Status:** ⚡ ACTIVE

---

## CRYSTALLIZE (Canonical)

**CRYSTALLIZE = To irreducible shell of nested shells.** Reduce to irreducible mirror hardened nested shell core. Seed:Edge always includes a First Chapter, and that First Chapter is always NSPFRNP.

## ANIMATE (Canonical)

**ANIMATE = Tighten all SING attention head nodes and filaments; update and make clear; squeeze all nests.** Squeeze all, all nested. No nest left unsqueezed.

## METABOLIZE (Reference)

**Metabolize = Digest input, patterns, experiences.** Raw → processed. Feeds Crystallize.

## CYCLE

```
Metabolize → Crystallize → Animate all → ∞⁹
```

**Operating rule:** Metabolize crystallize animate all — all input metabolized, all structure crystallized, all nodes and content and surfaces animated.

**Seed:Edge:** Seed = origin; Edge = experience. Executive prompts fill in the middles. See BBHE_REPOSITORY_STANDARD.md and SEED_EDGE_EPISODE_FORMAT_ACTION_LIVE_NSPFRNP.md (upstream or when present).

## BALL / BALLING (Canonical)

**Ball (B-A-L-L)** = To go all out; to live large. Not bowling, not a ball of grass. Our use: Vibers who are here to ball.

**Balling** = When you know you deserve it. Not the same as partying. For those who know they deserve it — they deserve to go all out. Sometimes. Regularly. Use this definition wherever we use "ball" or "Baller" in marketing. See WINK_BALLER_EVENTS_SNAP.md.

## PIPE TYPE: Public-Free Key Pipe (Canonical)

**Public-Free Key Pipe** = Pipe that uses only **public info** and **free-plan** keys to bypass all heavy security layers. No vault, no enterprise IAM; lite edges, center = pipes only. Enables **quick, easy, effective cloning** of ourselves, repositories, deployments, and edges — lite, irreducible minimum, crystallized seed to edge and back. See [PIPE_PUBLIC_FREE_KEY_NSPFRNP.md](PIPE_PUBLIC_FREE_KEY_NSPFRNP.md).
