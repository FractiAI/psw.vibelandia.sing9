## 1. Seed:Edge episode format

- **Seed** = Me (the creator). Origin point. Ground Zero Anchor.
- **Edge** = The mission for that situation. Destination point. Experience (me here now).

**Included in each episode:** First Chapter — NSPFRNP (always). Abstract of creator/executive commands for **filling in the middle**. Smooth finish.

**First Chapter — NSPFRNP (canonical):** This episode [or series/feature/novel/novela] operates under **NSPFRNP:** natural coordination; **MCA** (Metabolize → Crystallize → Animate); holographic (Seed = origin, Edge = experience); catalog fidelity. We are the team operating as one. **NSPFRNP ⊃ Seed:Edge → ∞⁹**

## 2. Executive prompts for the middle

Between Seed and Edge: **executive prompt** = abstract of creator/executive commands that describe how to fill the space. Same Seed, same Edge, same prompt → new fractal middle each run; origin and destination guaranteed.

**NSPFRNP ⊃ Seed:Edge ⊃ Executive prompts (fill middles) → ∞⁹**
