# Episode structure · Whole story first, then deep dives

**Purpose:** First we make **one 60-minute episode** that tells the **whole story**. Then we create **episodes that go deep** on any part of this story; mix and match. Remaining episodes and seasons = deep on different parts. Maybe a new format. We like it.

---

## Episode 1 · The whole story (60 minutes)

- **One episode** that tells the **entire story** from the storyboard and the story you transmitted.
- Uses the full set of frames/cards across all stacks, ordered so the narrative runs start to finish.
- Every frame is a **30-second fill** (or as cut); Seed–Edge–EP prompt drive the middle. Real individuals and real places throughout.
- This is the **spine**. Everything else branches from here.

### Delivery format (stream + images + music)

- **Captions:** **Stream** the full one-hour script as captions (not static pop-ups). One line per ~10 seconds; comfortable to read, not rushed. Script comes from `data/episode-1-script.json` (360 lines for 60 min) or is built from segment text.
- **Images:** Display at a **comfortable pace** — **3–4 frames every 30 seconds** (~8–10 sec per image) so the experience is pleasing to the eye. Script and images are **detached**: you can show more or fewer images; they don’t have to match the script 1:1.
- **Music:** Soundtracks by segment (playlists 1–7) as before.

### Production · Confirmed (no client involvement)

- **Soundtracks:** Production handles all soundtracks (sources, download, mapping). Client is not involved.
- **Soundtracks ↔ narrative:** Soundtracks are matched to the narrative by segment (7 acts = 7 playlists; each segment has its playlist).
- **Images ↔ narrative:** Images are tied to the narrative: slides are ordered by segment and narrative order; each segment has its images and its soundtrack.
- **Pause:** Play/Pause (button and Space/K) is available so the viewer can pause at any time to absorb the displayed image and caption.
- **Slides and music:** Slides advance on a comfortable timer (e.g. 3–4 per 30 sec). Soundtrack plays through by segment; when a track ends, the next track in that segment starts. Not rigid: no “one full track then one slide.”

### Emotional arc · Crystallized

The full hour is **metabolized into irreducible minimums** and **animated** with a clear emotional shape. See [EPISODE_1_CRYSTALLIZED.md](EPISODE_1_CRYSTALLIZED.md).

- **Middle:** Inspirational, moving — **crying in the middle.** The heart of the story lands; the viewer is moved.
- **End:** Triumphant. **“We are the champions.”** Fist-pumping. **Stand up on your seats.** The story closes at full lift.

## Episodes 2+ · Deep dives (mix and match)

- **Go deep** on any part of the story: a character, a location, a stack, a theme, a time slice.
- **Mix and match** cards/frames from the catalog. Different combinations for different episodes.
- Examples: an episode that goes deep on **Josephine's**; one on **crystalline**; one on **genuine hearts**; one on **destination / versions of me**; one on a single character or place.
- **Seasons** = we can group deep-dive episodes into seasons (e.g. Season 1 = whole story + first set of deep dives).

---

## Format

- **Maybe a new format:** one 60-min “whole story” plus many shorter (or variable-length) “deep dives” that reuse the same frames in new orders and contexts. Lock that pattern.
- **Trading card logic:** the same card can appear in the 60-min episode and in one or more deep-dive episodes. Catalog and categories make that easy.

---

## Flow

1. **Catalog and cards** = all stacks linked to Google Docs; every photo studied, categorized, turned into a frame/card with real names and places.
2. **Edit Episode 1** = 60 min, whole story, using the catalog.
3. **Plan Episodes 2+** = choose which parts to go deep on; pull cards from catalog; mix and match; cut episodes.
4. **Seasons** = bundle as needed.
