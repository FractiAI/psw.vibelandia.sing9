# Naming and places · Real individuals, real places

**Purpose:** Change all placeholder or fictional names to **respect actual individuals and actual places**. Every card and every episode uses **real people and real places** where they apply. Document substitutions here so we stay consistent across the 60-minute episode and all deep-dive episodes.

---

## Policy

- **Locations:** Keep **real place names** — no dilution. **Davis, California** · **Reno** · **Homer and Seldovia, Alaska** (McDonald's Spit) · **Miami** · **Puerto Rico** · **Brazil** · **Argentina** · **Cartagena**. Actual locations, venues, streets, regions. Everything tuned; we don’t dilute.
- **Individuals (when we protect them):** Use **story names** instead of real names for people/businesses we’re protecting. See **Protected names** table below. Everyone else: use real names (or the names they want used).
- **Fictional / story-only:** When we are deliberately in fiction (e.g. Gold Rush story), that stays as is. This doc lists **real** places (always kept) and **protected** people/businesses (story names only in narrative/cards/episodes).

## Protected names (story names only)

For these people/businesses we use **story names** in cards, narrative, and episodes — to protect them while keeping the story tuned.

| Story name | Real / context | Notes |
|------------|----------------|--------|
| **Josie** | She goes by Joe; matriarch | Spanish/familiar version (not Josephine). |
| **Bamboo** / **D.O.O.** | Dan — bamboo employer | D-O-O. Slave-master / under-the-table boss; bamboo scenes. |
| **K-9** | Christy — evil daughter of Josie | Fitting: canine teeth. Exploiter; inheritance fights; ripped him off; never heard from again. |
| **Gigi** / **JJ and crew** | Grateful Dead abductor hippies | G-G, J-J. Two weeks, fake stories, abuse, near-death. |

Use **Josie**, **Bamboo** (or **D.O.O.**), **K-9**, **Gigi** (and **JJ and crew**) in the narrative layer and on cards whenever we refer to these. Locations stay **Davis California, Reno, Homer and Seldovia Alaska (McDonald's Spit), Miami**, etc. — real.

## Substitutions (fill as you process)

List any **placeholder → real** substitution here (for everyone *not* in the protected table). Add rows as you go through the stacks and cards.

| Placeholder / working name | Real individual or place | Notes |
|----------------------------|---------------------------|--------|
| *(example)* John Doe       | [Actual name]             | Character in Stack 2. |
| *(example)* The bar       | [Actual venue name]       | Location in Stack 1. |
| *(add rows below)*         |                           | |

## How to use when building cards

- When you turn a photo into a **frame / trading card**, fill **real_individuals** and **real_places** on the card from this policy and this table.
- When we cut the **60-minute episode** or any **deep-dive episode**, use these same names so every mention of a person or place respects the actual individual or place.
