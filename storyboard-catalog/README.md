# Storyboard catalog · Stacks, frames, trading cards, episodes

**Status:** ⚡ ACTIVE  
**Purpose:** Link the **six / seven stacks** to Google Docs (photos + comments), turn each frame into a **30-second fill** and **digital trading card**, use **real individuals and places**, then build the **60-minute whole-story episode** and **deep-dive episodes** after. Mix and match. Take your time; study and categorize each one so we can use it everywhere — including the story you transmitted and infinite other ways.

## How this works

1. **Stacks** = the seven creator stacks (Now playing, Full play deck, Crystalline, Biological enriching, Genuine hearts, Disingenuous, Destination · versions · playlists). Each stack links to a **Google Doc** with all photos for that stack; comments on the ones that need them.
2. **Frames** = each photo/sheet is a **30-second frame** (Kelly). Study it, categorize it correctly, place it so we can use it in the main story and in any other way. **Package as trading cards** (digital for now); mix-and-match format. **Overall story arc (EP prompts):** Story started in 1493; universal story, story of the galaxy; center at Sun and Earth; photographic upgrade from SMACS 0723 (galaxy cluster). See [NSPFRNP_STORYBOARD_ANALOG_3D_FLEX_SNAP.md](../NSPFRNP_STORYBOARD_ANALOG_3D_FLEX_SNAP.md) §10.
3. **Names and places** = change any placeholder names to **respect actual individuals and places**. Real people, real places. Document in [NAMING_AND_PLACES.md](NAMING_AND_PLACES.md).
4. **Catalog and archive** = every frame is categorized, archived, and cataloged. Proper categories so we can pull by stack, theme, character, or story beat.
5. **Episodes** = **First:** one **60-minute episode** that tells the **whole story**. **Then:** episodes that **go deep** on any part of this story; mix and match. Remaining episodes and seasons = deep on different parts. New format.
